    content: "<p>The course is broken up into four sections.</p><p>First the basics of Mocha; why to use Mocha in the first place, how to navigate the interface, and a quick start into typical workflows. Relevant for all users regardless of where they are using Mocha eg Mocha AE, Mocha Pro or even the built-in Mocha in Continuum and Sapphire video filters.</p><p>Secondly we explore motion tracking, what it is, how we create motion tracked data and most importantly how you can use that data to do a variety of different tasks.</p><p>In the third part, we focus on rotoscoping, the process of creating and animating shapes on our footage. This is a deep look at Mocha's toolset, structured so you can quickly get just the basics, or stay for the complete experience.</p><p>The final part focuses on Pro features found only in Mocha Pro.  These include PowerMesh for creating warp stabilizations and inserts, and helping roto work with Spline Warp. How to “art direct” your stabilizations using the Stabilize module.  Object removal and extensions with the Remove & Megaplate modules. Plus the importance of Lens calibrated works for some common tasks.</p>"

In this two part exercise you will be starting from the very basics of how to take a shot, create a planar track with it, and use that tracking and shape data in your host application. This first course focuses on creating a project in Mocha, learning the most important tools in the interface, a breif explanation how the planar tracker works, and tracking parameters in essentials mode.</p><p>At the end of this brief two part video, you will know the mechanics of using Mocha on a basic shot.</p>"

Specifically, how to set it up, adding keyframes, common issues with adjusting the track, and when you shouldn’t be using AdjustTrack at all.</p><p>What happens if your track is drifting or not quite exactly where you want it? That's when adjust track comes into play. This exercise covers adjust track, specifically identifying the problem with your track and knowing when to adjust your track or simply start over. We cover the in depth controls for setting your Adjust Track Points, talking about what the different transforms do, setting your reference frame, and adjusting your reference points. We will also cover when to use the Surface View & when your shot is a good candidate for Auto Step.

We go through a mental checklist to see how to improve troublesome tracks.

    content: "<p>Rotoscoping is a word with a long tradition in cinema.  If you ever watch modern television and films, you will also be experiencing the results of extensive rotoscoping.</p><p>The vast majority of rotoscoping is used to create masks. These masks can be used for a number of different things; secondary color correction, limiting effects to certain areas, or in compositing for keeping parts of the image over the areas that we have replaced to create a realistic result. The usefulness of accurate masks cannot be overstated. Every time you see a more than basic effect, there will be some form of masking in there.</p><p>Rotoscoping is a core VFX skill.  Whatever your role is in post-production, you will encounter it to some degree or other. You may not want or need to be pulling off fully articulated roto objects. But there is always going to be something you want to keep in or out the shot. This is a job for rotoscoping.</p><p>Roto can be a very time-intensive process. The key to saving time, is to identify what you are trying to achieve with your mask.</p><p>In the next few exercises we will be focusing on how you can get the best results with the least amount of effort, using Mocha to do as much of the work as possible.</p>"

    content: "<p>Stabilized footage will have some blank areas that need to be filled in somehow.  This tutorial shows some of the options you have with Mocha, including auto scaling, custom fixed frames and Auto Fill. We look at the options these give us, and discuss which is the correct one for different scenarios.</p><p>When we have completed this section, you will understand what the Stabilize module can give you, and which tools you should use for different shots.</p>"

In this exercise, we go over removing a logo from an exercise machine in changing light conditions. We will explore color changes and offscreen motion. We will also talk about when to use a remove and when not to use remove, for instance, when a patch or paint is better. We will touch more on Interpolate vs Linear lighting changes and talk about about where to pull your cleanplate from and how to adjust it.</p><p>Specifically we will cover tracking When You Can't See Behind the Object,When to Make a Cleanplate, Cleaning Your Cleanplate , Testing Your Cleanplate, and finally Rendering Your Cleanplate Remove.</p>"

Sometimes, a handheld shot will be extremely shaky, and this can make cleanplates tedious because of the sheet amount of cleanplates you can need to finish a remove. Enter Megaplates, a large format plate that covers the entire motion of your shot, based on the track. We will talk about tracking for Megaplates and we will go over the details for creating Megaplates. We will talk about the best ways to start cleaup or paint work on your MegaPlate. And lastly, we will show you how to start using Megaplates in the Remove module.At the end of this Remove module overview, there should be very few shots you can't tackle.</p>"
