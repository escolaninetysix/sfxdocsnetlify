    content: "<p>First part of creating a motion graphics title sequence with an Eighties flavor in Adobe After Effects.  In this section, Ben Brownlee breaks down the process of creating the master tile, which will be a large part of the finished video.  You will learn how to create a neon tube shape out of any mask shape, plus some Boris FX Sapphire filters : S_Zap, S_EmbossGlass and S_WarpPuff.</p><p>You will also see how to creating auto looping effects using After Effects Expressions and see some simple code that gives big results. It also makes duplicating layers to build up the effect a breeze.</p>"

    content: "<p>Second part of creating a motion graphics title sequence with an Eighties flavor in Adobe After Effects.  In this part, Ben Brownlee  shows how to effortlessly take our tile and make a seamless animated room out of it. Going beyond the basics, you will learn how to make an infinitely scrolling 3D floor with 2D effects and After Effects expressions. The base of the floor will use Boris FX Sapphire S_WarpTransform.</p><p>To add a unique camera look to the scene we break out and explore S_FreeLens, to take control of depth and add a twist of color distortion.</p><p>To build up the texture and depth of the floor we will revisit an effect we used previously, S_WarpPuff and enhance it with a clever use of S_WarpRepeat.  This gets our floor layer in a good place to build up the rest of the scene.</p>"

    content: "<p>Third part of creating a motion graphics title sequence with an Eighties flavor in Adobe After Effects.  In this section, Ben Brownlee begins to build up the rest of the world around our floor animation. We create realistic but stylized animated clouds with Boris FX Sapphire's S_CloudsMultiColor.  With just a few clicks we have an impending storm moving towards the camera.</p><p>Following that, we add a highly stylized sun. This has to be flexible to prepare for any changes we might want to make further along in the project. In steps Sapphire's S_WipeStripes and S_GradientRadial.</p><p>We then begin to test how that is going to work with the Bigger Better Glow we'll be applying at the very end of our project, and we make appropriate adjustments for that.</p>"

    content: "<p>Fourth part of creating a motion graphics title sequence with an Eighties flavor in Adobe After Effects.  It's now time to turn to creating the text elements with Ben Brownlee and Boris FX Sapphire taking the lead.</p><p>Finding the right font is only part of the battle. We look at how we can recycle work from previous parts of the series to maintain a consistent look in our sequence.  The same work we did for neon tubes can be easily adjusted to make a slick, shiny text effect, that looks 3D but is a lot faster to create and customize.</p><p>When approaching the second piece of text, we want to keep things cleaner but still get the right amount of distressed and distorted look. We don't want boring text!  We also don't need to spend too much time on it and see how to use some of Sapphire's thousands of presets.</p>"

    content: "<p>Fifth and final part of creating a motion graphics title sequence with an Eighties flavor in Adobe After Effects. Ben Brownlee shows how important it is to choose the right transition for the job.  Boris FX Sapphire has over 60 transitions to from, so it is important to find the most appropriate ones.</p><p>As well as exploring the transitions themselves, we see some unique features in Sapphire that extend the graphical possibilities of a simple wipe.  Each element gets attention to finish off the animation.</p><p>Once all the elements are in place, all that's left is to bring the final touches to sew all the elements together. We add more lighting effects with S_Glow and tricks with adjustments layers, and see how a sprinkling of S_FilmEffect is enough to carry the effect through to its final look.</p>"
