 **Spotlight Shader**


In this section we will cover the Spotlight IP Shader available in Title Studio with Continuum 2019. Spotlight adds a colored spotlight to the scene with blending modes and an optional alpha generator.. Unlike the Title Studio Spotlight, the IP Shader Spotlight can only be applied in 2 D Composite Mode and may be applied to individual objects within a scene.

**Source X & Y** sets the source point of the spotlight. This is where the light originates from and it can be adjusted manually via the parameters or with the onscreen widget.


**Destination X & Y** sets the destination point of the spotlight. This is where the light is focused and it can be adjusted manually via the parameters or with the onscreen widget.


**Offset X & Y** sets the offset point of the spotlight. It can be adjusted manually via the parameter or with the onscreen widget.


**Elevation** sets the height of the spotlight source point in relation to the destination. Higher values will move the source point further from the destination, increasing the radius of the spotlight.

**Spot Cut Off** adjusts the focal point of the light source. Higher values will create tighter, narrower focal points.


**Edge Fall Off** adjusts the softness of the spotlight edge. Lower values will create a sharper edge, while higher values will create a softer, more feathered edge.


**Intensity** adjusts the overall brightness and intensity of the spotlight.


**Ambient** adjusts the amount of ambient light that the spotlight generates. Higher values will result in more ambient light, allowing you to better visualize areas outside of the spotlight.


**Color** allows you to use the color chip or eyedropper to set the color of the spotlight.


**Composite Mode** allows the user to set how the spotlight composites within the scene. Standard composite modes *Add*, *Multiply*, *Screen* and *Overlay* are available.


**Generate Alpha**, when enabled, uses the area outside of the spotlight to generate alpha regions.


**Mix With Original** blends the effect with the original object
