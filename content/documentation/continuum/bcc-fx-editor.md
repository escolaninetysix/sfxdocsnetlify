### The File Menu


#### Setups


A Setup takes a snapshot of the filter’s parameters. Setups can be saved and loaded and are independent of the image they were originally applied to. If you are loading a Setup containing multiple filters that was saved from the standalone or photo plug-in versions, only the filter that you are currently working with is modified by the settings contained in the Setup.


Open Setup: Opens a previously saved Setup.


Save Setup: Takes a snapshot of the filter’s parameters and saves it as a Setup file. This Setup file can later be loaded to the same or a different image.


#### Preferences


Preferences allow you to customize default settings.


**Thumbnail Size**: You can select whether the FX Editor interface uses either a small or large thumbnail size. Medium thumbnails are the default.


* *Small*: Small thumbnails are used in the FX Editor interface.
* *Medium*: Medium thumbnails are used in the FX Editor interface.
* *Large*: Large thumbnails are used in the FX Editor interface.


#### Preview Size


The BCC FX Editor works at a maximum resolution as defined by the Preview Size–the default being 2048 by 2048 pixels. Never fear, when your image is saved, the FX Editor always processes at the resolution of the original image.


* *1024*: The FX Editor works at a maximum resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels.
* *2048*: The FX Editor works at a maximum resolution of 2048 x 2048 pixels.
* *4096*: The FX Editor works at a maximum resolution of 4096 x 4096 pixels.


#### Downsampling


At large preview sizes, interaction may slow down when adjusting filter parameters. To maintain fast processing during adjustments, you can enable Downsampling.


**Adaptive**: Automatically downsamples the image if required.


**2:1**: Automatically downsamples the image by a factor of 2.


**4:1**: Automatically downsamples the image by a factor of 4.


**8:1**: Automatically downsamples the image by a factor of 8.


#### Preview Scaling


**Point**: Uses a lower quality scaling method when displaying the image in the Viewer. Point is more accurate when applying filters such as grain and sharpen, but when zooming in, the image will display “chunky” artifacts.


**Bicubic**: Uses a smooth scaling method when displaying the image in the Viewer. Bicubic can mask the effect of grain and sharpen filters because of its inherent smoothing, but doesn’t suffer from the Point methods chunkiness when zooming in.


**GPU Rendering**: Enables or disables GPU rendering.


#### The Edit Menu


**Undo/Redo**: Undo or redo operations.


**Undo/Redo History**: Undo/Redo has a history, so you can jump to any item in the history by picking it from the menu.
