 ### Overview


Hue-Saturation-Lightness converts the image to the Hue/Saturation/Lightness color space, makes corrections to the image, and converts it back to RGB.


### Function


**Presets and Common Controls**


BCC filters come with a library of factory installed presets plus the ability to create your own custom presets and preview them with the BCC FX Browser™.


BCC filters also include common controls that configure global effect preferences and other host-specific effect settings.


For more information about working with presets and other common controls, [Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-common-controls/).

 


**Compare Mode**


The BCC Compare Mode provides a convenient mechanism to compare the effect result with the original source layer. It provides several variations on basic split-screen views with the filtered clip placed next to the unedited original.


For more information on the Compare Mode,[Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-compare-mode/).

 


**Hue** cycles the colors in the image around the color wheel in the HSL color space. Most color corrections require very small changes in the Hue setting; adjustments of 10° or less usually suffice. Adjustments larger than 10° usually produce very dramatic color changes.


**Hue Fine Control** allows you to fine tune the Hue parameter in increments of 1.


**Saturation** adjusts the intensity of each color’s hue in the image. Negative values remove color from the image, and positive values add color to the image.


**Lightness** adjusts the lightness of the image.


**Mix with Original** blends the source and filtered images. Use this parameter to animate the effect from the unfiltered to the filtered image without adjusting other settings, or to reduce the effect of the filter by mixing it with the source image.


 


**PixelChooser**


The BCC PixelChooser provides simple, built-in masking of the effect result.  The PixelChooser is generally used to select a portion of the image and restrict an effect to just the selected area while maintaining the original image content in unselected regions.  The selection can be based on geometric shapes or on the image’s luma/color properties.
