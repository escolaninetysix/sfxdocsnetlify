 **User Marks** are used to mark a location in the timeline and are associated with a particular timecode and not a specific frame. A color indicator appears in the timeline for each timecode that you mark.  To open the User Mark window, choose **Window > Show User Marks Window**.

You can associate *comments* with these marks in the User Marks window. For example, you might enter a description of a title that you want to add later. Comments appear in the Composite window and Preview windows when the CTI is on that User Mark. The comments are not displayed in the rendered effect.


You can also *color code* User Marks for easy reference. When you create a User Mark, an indicator with the selected color appears in the timeline. You can turn off this display by deselecting the Show User Marks in Timeline and Show User Marks in Preview Window options in the Appearance tab of the Preferences window.


You can also quickly move between User Marks by using the Go to Next Mark and Go to Previous Mark commands.
