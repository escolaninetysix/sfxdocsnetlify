NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021, the BCC+ Color Gradient filter colors and or darkens only a portion of the image giving you the ability to simulate any Color Gradient filter. Presets for your favorite color gradient filters are provided as well as the ability to create custom colors. There is a graduated transition for a smooth color blend between the colored/darkened portion and the original image. Color Gradient is especially useful for changing and enhancing the color of the sky.

Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
