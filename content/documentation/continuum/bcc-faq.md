Note: If you used the “O” number when installing the product then it should automatically show up in the Serial Number box.


**4a.** Now, you may click on either the Activate button (to **activate** the number live over the internet) or the **Alternative** button (to activate the number by e-mail or telephone):

**4b.** When you click the **Alternative** button, a window comes up showing the **Unique Product ID** number which you must provide to **Boris FX** to receive the **Unlock Code** for that system:

Note: You need to click **Alternative** button if you do not have the **“O”** number or if you do not want to Activate live over the internet. You must then provide the **Unique Product ID** number to **Boris FX** to receive the **Unlock Code** for that system. **Unlock Code** is needed to license the product when you choose the **Alternative** option.


**5.** Once the number is activated (either via Activate button or via Alternative button), a window comes up stating that the product is now Licensed on that system. You can deactivate the number at any time by clicking on the **Deactivate** button to be able to install & activate/license the product on another system:
