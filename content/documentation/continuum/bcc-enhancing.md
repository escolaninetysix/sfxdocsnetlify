### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


**Enhancing**: Adjusts the saturation of red, green or blue hues.


#### Matte


* **Presets**: A matte is created based on the hue of the image to create the enhancement effect. Select from Red, Green or Blue preset hue mattes from the pop-up menu or use the Hue eyedropper to pick a *Custom* color off of the screen.
* **Hue**: When adjusting the Hue parameter, you are selecting the hue of the image which will be enhanced. The Hue Color picker allows you to select a custom matte color, but is only active when the *Custom* option has been selected in the Presets pop-up menu.
* **Range**: Increases or decreases the range of values in the hue matte. A low Range value indicates a narrow range of values. A high Range value indicates a large range of values included in the matte.
* **Blur**: Sets the softness of the matte by using a fast, quality blur.


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
