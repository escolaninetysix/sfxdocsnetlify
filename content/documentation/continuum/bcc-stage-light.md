### Overview


The BCC Stage Light filter was designed to augment the built-in lights in Adobe After Effects or to function as a 3D lighting system when used in supported non Adobe After Effects hosts.


While the lighting system in After Effects is indeed rich and powerful, it is incapable of generating real-world volumetric lighting, such as one might see when stage lights are used to illuminate talent on a real set. The BCC Stage Light filter generates 3D volumetric lighting with control over the visible light levels as well as other real world stage-light attributes such as smoke particles. The BCC Stage Light filter creates this effect using either the host native After Effects lights, or via the use of the filters own built-in 3D lighting system.


### Function


To use the filter you must first apply it to a solid color layer, an adjustment layer or an image clip. The filter is set to generate light from the built-in lights and uses the built-in camera by default. To use it in a host without a camera or lighting system simply apply the filter to any clip and use the built-in filter camera and lighting controls to light and navigate around the scene in 3D space.


To use the After Effects light and camera system you can click on the checkboxes located at the top of the filter parameter list in the effects control window. Unless there is an AE camera and light present in the comp no effect will be visible when you select this option, therefore, if you have not done so already, add a spot light or a point light and an active camera to the scene. The BCC Stage Light filter will automatically detect the added light(s) and use it to create volumetric scene lighting.


As you move the camera around the scene, you will notice that the volumetric light that is generated by the filter will remain locked into the scene and you will be able to move around the light and view it from any angle. Of course you can also animate the AE light, which will, in turn, animate the volumetric light that is being applied to the scene as the AE light and the volumetric light effect that the filter is generating are locked together in space and time.


If you have more than one light in the scene, the filter will pick up these lights and apply the same level of volumetric light to each visible light. There are options in the filter to determine whether a light in the scene is used or ignored as well as the option to control the level of volumetric lighting for each individual light in the scene using the built-in host lighting controls such as the Light Intensity, the Shadow Darkness or the Shadow Diffusion parameters.


For an interesting and cool look, try enabling the Smoke option. The smoke is an auto-animating effect and you can control the amount of smoke and the speed by which it animates in the scene.


**Presets and Common Controls**


BCC filters come with a library of factory installed presets plus the ability to create your own custom presets and preview them with the BCC FX Browser™.


BCC filters also include common controls that configure global effect preferences and other host-specific effect settings.


For more information about working with presets and other common controls, [Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-common-controls/).

 


**Preset Load / Save Mechanism Group**


The preset load / save mechanism is located at the top of every filter in Boris Continuum.


Use the preset load save mechanism to load the factory installed or user generated animated and / or static presets for this filter or to save the current setting as a new animated or static preset.


**Use Comp Camera checkbox**: When enabled, the Lens Flare 3D filter will ignore the built-in camera and instead use the AE native camera for preview and final render of the current scene. In the case where there is more than one camera in the scene, the filter will use the camera that is placed at highest level in the layer stack.


**Use Comp Light**: Enable this option to use the After Effects 3D lighting system. When disabled, the built-in lights are used to generate volumetric lighting.


 


**Built-­in Camera Group**


Contains contextually aware parameters that are used to control the built-in 3D camera system.


**Camera Model pop-up**: Used to select the desired camera system. There are three available options to select from:
