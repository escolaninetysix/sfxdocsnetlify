### Overview


The Color Palette filter provides a number of ways to select colors from the host user interface for your project. You can also use the Color Palette filter to set colors which can be used any number of times within the current project.


### 


### **Parameter Controls**


**Presets and Common Controls**


BCC filters come with a library of factory installed presets plus the ability to create your own custom presets and preview them  with the BCC FX Browser™.


BCC filters also include common controls that configure global effect preferences and other host-specific effect settings.


For more information about working with presets and other common controls, [Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-common-controls/).

 


The **Color Ramp** provides an array of colors that can be selected with the Eyedropper tool.


**View** determines what type of output is displayed.


* *Color Picker* displays a gradient showing all of the colors with the chosen Hue value.
* *Source* displays the source image.
* *Swatches* displays an array of 24 swatches. Each swatch corresponds to one of the 24 selected Colors.
* *Tweak* *Swatches* displays an array of 24 swatches corresponding to the selected **Colors**. You can adjust the RGB values of the colors by setting the **Tweak** menu to *RGB* and using the **Tweak Red, Tweak Green**, and **Tweak Blue** controls. Alternately, you can set the **Tweak Menu** to *HSL* to adjust the colors using the **Tweak Hue, Tweak Saturation,** and **Tweak Lightness** parameters.
* *Vary* *Hue* *Sat* displays an array of 24 swatches. The swatches contain a gradient showing colors similar in their Hue and Saturation values; the center of each swatch corresponds to one of the chosen Colors. The color’s hue varies from the top to the bottom of the swatch, and the saturation varies from left to right.
* *Vary Hue Lightness* is similar to Vary Hue Sat but varies the lightness of the color from left to right.
* *Vary Sat Lightness* is similar to Vary Hue Sat, but varies the saturation from top to bottom and the lightness from left to right.
* *Vary Red Green* is similar to Vary Hue Sat, but varies the color’s red channel value from top to bottom, and its green channel value from left to right.
* Vary Red Blue is similar to Vary Hue Sat, but varies the color’s red channel value from top to bottom, and its blue channel value from left to right.
* *Vary Green Blue* is similar to Vary Hue Sat, but varies the color’s blue channel value from top to bottom, and its green channel value from left to right.
* *The Vary Color 1 – 24* options allow you to see a larger number of variants of the selected color. For example, suppose you selected *Vary Color 1*. The output is an array of 24 swatches in which the top left swatch shows Color 1. The next 11 swatches show hue and saturation variations of Color 1 with the swatches becoming successively lighter. The final 12 swatches show hue and saturation variations of **Color 1** with the swatches becoming successively darker.
