NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021, The BCC+ Bleach Bypass filter applies a film laboratory technique where, by skipping the bleach stage in the color processing sequence, silver is retained in the image along with the color dyes. The result is effectively a black and white image superimposed on a color image. Bleach Bypass images have increased contrast, reduced saturation, often giving a pastel effect.

**Before and After**

### Presets and the FX Editor

 The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 

To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 

### Filter Parameters

**Amount**: Controls the strength of the Bleach Bypass filter.

**Saturation:** Adjusts the saturation of the image*.*Positive values saturate, negative values desaturate.

**Contrast:** Adjusts the contrast of the image. Positive values increase contrast, negative values decrease contrast.

**Temperature:** Sets the color temperature of the image. Dragging the slider to the right makes the image cooler (bluer) and dragging the slider to the left makes the image warmer (redder).

**PixelChooser:**The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
