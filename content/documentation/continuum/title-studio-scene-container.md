 In this section we will cover the various tabs and parameters that are available in Title Studio when the Scene Container is selected. The information in this section applies to specific parameters available to Scene-Level containers. Information on the various parameters and tabs available to 3D Containers and Title Containers may be found here.


 


## [The Container Position Tab](/documentation/continuum/title-studio-container-position-tab)


The Container Position Tab contains controls for the position and scale of the container, and allow you to rotate it X, Y, and Z space. It is almost identical to the Position Tab for Shapes. Changes made to parameters in the container position tab affect the effect as a whole, but do not change the individual object parameters.

## [The Camera Tab](/documentation/continuum/title-studio-the-camera-tab)


The Camera Parameter Tab provides control over the camera perspective of the object, including position, orbit, orientation and depth of field. The Camera tab includes five camera views. This is useful for setting up complex effects. Only the current view is rendered with the effect.

## [The Lights Tab](/documentation/continuum/title-studio-lights-tab)


The Lights Parameter Tab provides controls that allow you to apply up to three separate lights to the effect. These lights are modeled as non-directional point sources that can be positioned in 3D space. You can also adjust and animate the lights’ color and intensity, cast shadows, and control the amount of ambient light on the entire object.

## [The Render Tab](/documentation/continuum/title-studio-render-tab)


The Render Tab provides controls that affect playback, transparency in certain cases, motion blur and allow you to fine-tune the finished look of your effect.
