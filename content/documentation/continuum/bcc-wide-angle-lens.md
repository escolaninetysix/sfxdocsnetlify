### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


**Distortion**: Pulls the corners of the image outward.


**X and Y Correction**: X and Y Correction compensate for the deformation introduced with the Distortion parameter.


### Working with The Filter


1. Apply BCC+ Wide Angle Lens from the Lens unit.
2. Start by adjusting the Distortion control to add the desired wide angle look.


You may need to also adjust the X and Y Correction parameters which compensate for the deformation introduced with the Distortion parameter.
