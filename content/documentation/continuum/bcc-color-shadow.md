### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


**View:** Allows you to set the viewer to display various outputs for the Color Shadow.


* *Output*: Shows the default look of the BCC+ Color Shadow filter on the image.
* *Grad:* Shows the color gradient. Useful when determining the look of the gradient used in the output.


**Threshold:** Sets the amount of image detail.


**Invert:** Changes whether the gradient is in the background or foreground.


**Background Color:** Sets the color of the background. Select the desired color using the color picker.


**Color 1:** Sets the color for the top half of the image. Select the desired color using the color picker. 


**Color 2:** Sets the color for the bottom half of the image. Select the desired color using the color picker. 


#### Grad


Grad is the gradient transition area between the two colors. It’s direction, corners and size can be adjusted. 


**Type:** Controls the direction of the gradient


* *Top-to-bottom:* The direction of the gradient is from top to bottom.
* *Bottom-to-top:* The direction of the gradient is from bottom to top.
* *Left-to-right:* The direction of the gradient is from left to right.
* *Right-to-left:* The direction of the gradient is from right to left.
* *Horizontal Strip*: Horizontal strip gradient gradient
* *Vertical Strip:* Vertical stripgradient grad.


**Size:** Adjusts the overall size of the gradient.


**Angle:** Adjusts the angle of the gradient


The grad can also be corner pinned by adjusting the Corner Pin sliders as well as dragging the four points on the corners of the screen.


Note: You may need to zoom the image out a bit to see the corner points. In addition, to see and adjust the corner points in After Effects, make sure that the effect title in the Effect Controls window is highlighted. For Final Cut Pro, you must activate the cross hair icon next to the corner position parameters to see and adjust the corner points on the screen.


* Upper-Left: Controls the X and Y position of the Upper Left Point.
* Upper-Right: Controls the X and Y position of the Upper Right Point.
* Lower-Right: Controls the X and Y position of the Lower Right Point.
* Lower-Left: Controls the X and Y position of the Lower Left Point.


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
