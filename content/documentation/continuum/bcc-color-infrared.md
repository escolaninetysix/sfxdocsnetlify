NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021 The BCC+ Color Infrared filter simulates infrared filters used in conjunction with infrared sensitive film or sensors to produce very interesting false-color images with a dreamlike or sometimes lurid appearance.

### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


**Magenta:** Adjusts the amount of magenta in the image.


**Blue:** Adjusts the amount of blue in the image.


**Hue:** Adjusts the hue in any non-blue areas of the image.


**Contrast:** Adjusts the overall contrast of the image.


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
