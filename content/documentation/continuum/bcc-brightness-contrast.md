### **Presets and Common Controls**

BCC filters come with a library of factory installed presets plus the ability to create your own custom presets and preview them with the BCC FX Browser™.

BCC filters also include common controls that configure global effect preferences and other host-specific effect settings.

For more information about working with presets and other common controls, [Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-common-controls/).

### Filter Parameters

**C﻿ompare Mode:** The BCC Compare Mode provides a convenient mechanism to compare the effect result with the original source layer. It provides several variations on basic split-screen views with the filtered clip placed next to the unedited original.

For more information on the Compare Mode,[Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-compare-mode/).

**Brightness:** Used to adjust the brightness of the image. Increasing the Brightness setting pushes colors toward white, and decreasing the setting pushes colors toward black.

**Contrast:** Used to adjust the contrast of the image. Increasing the Contrast setting pushes colors toward pure colors, and decreasing the setting pushes colors toward 50% gray.

**Channels:** Used to select the RGB channel that will be adjusted. 

* *R﻿GB*: The filter is applied equally to the RGB channel. 
* *R﻿ed*: The filter is applied only to the Red channel.
* *G﻿reen*: The filter is applied only to the Green channel.
* *B﻿lue*: The filter is applied only to the Blue channel.
* *R﻿ed and Green:* The filter is applied to the Red and Green channel equally.
* *R﻿ed and Blue*: The filter is applied to the Red and Blue channel equally.
* *G﻿reen and Blue*: The filter is applied to the Green and Blu﻿e channel equally.
* *D﻿ifference*: uses the difference between each filtered channel and the corresponding source channel. 

**Mix with Original** blends the source and filtered images. Use this parameter to animate the effect from the unfiltered to the filtered image without adjusting other settings, or to reduce the effect of the filter by mixing it with the source image.

### **PixelChooser/ Mocha Gro**up

**Mocha Mask**: Click to launch the Mocha custom UI

The **BCC PixelChooser** provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
