### Presets and the FX Editor

To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


#### Exposure


* **Edges**: Lightens or darkens the edges of the image.

#### Spot


A radial gradient is used to lighten or darken the edges or center of the image. 


* **Position**: There is an on-screen control in the center of the image. By clicking and dragging the on-screen control, the position of the spot can be adjusted.
* **Position X**: The horizontal position of the spot.
* **Position Y**: The vertical position of the spot.
	+ Note:In some host programs, you must highlight the effect title in the Effect Controls window to see the on-screen controls.
* **Aspect**: The aspect ratio of the spot.
* **Radius**: The un-blurred radius of the spot.
* **Falloff Radius**: The blurred edge radius.

**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
