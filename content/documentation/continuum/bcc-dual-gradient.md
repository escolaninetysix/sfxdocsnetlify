### Presets and the FX Editor


To select from a selection of factory installed and user-generated presets, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets window.


### Filter Parameters


* **Presets**: Select one of the filters from the pop-up menu.
* **Color**: The Color parameter sets the color of the grad through the use of a standard color picker.
* **Opacity**: Sets the opacity of the color filter.
* **Color 2**: The Color 2 controls are the same as the controls for Color 1 except it is applied to the bottom half of the image.
* **Preserve Highlights**: Preserves the white areas of the image.
* **Exposure Compensation**: Exposure Compensation adds back the brightness loss as a result of the filter application.


#### Grad


Grad is the transition area between the two tints. Its direction, corners and size can be adjusted.


**Type:** Controls the direction of the gradient


* *Top-to-bottom:* The direction of the gradient is from top to bottom.
* *Bottom-to-top:* The direction of the gradient is from bottom to top.
* *Left-to-right:* The direction of the gradient is from left to right.
* *Right-to-left:* The direction of the gradient is from right to left.
* *Horizontal Strip*: Horizontal strip gradient gradient
* *Vertical Strip:* Vertical stripgradient grad.


**Size:** Adjusts the overall size of the gradient.


**Angle:** Adjusts the angle of the gradient


The grad can also be corner pinned by adjusting the Corner Pin sliders as well as dragging the four points on the corners of the screen.


Note: You may need to zoom the image out a bit to see the corner points. In addition, to see and adjust the corner points in After Effects, make sure that the effect title in the Effect Controls window is highlighted. For Final Cut Pro, you must activate the cross hair icon next to the corner position parameters to see and adjust the corner points on the screen.


* Upper-Left: Controls the X and Y position of the Upper Left Point.
* Upper-Right: Controls the X and Y position of the Upper Right Point.
* Lower-Right: Controls the X and Y position of the Lower Right Point.
* Lower-Left: Controls the X and Y position of the Lower Left Point.
