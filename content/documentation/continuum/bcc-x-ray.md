### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


**Black and White:** Select the type of black and white filter to be applied to your color image from the **Filter** menu.


* *Normal:* Converts the color image to a monochrome image.
* *Red:* Simulates a red filter in black and white photography.
* *Green:* Simulates a green filter in black and white photography.
* *Blue:* Simulates a blue filter in black and white photography.
* *Yellow:* Simulates a yellow filter in black and white photography.
* *Orange:* Simulates an orange filter in black and white photography.


**Brightness:** Adjusts the brightness of the image. Positive values brighten, negative values darken.


**Contrast:** Adjusts the contrast of the image. Positive values increase contrast, negative values decrease contrast.


**Gamma:** Adjusts the gamma of the image. The gamma adjustment leaves the white and black points the same and only modifies the values in-between. Positive values lighten the midtones, negative values darken the midtones.


The **Color** parameter group contains options for adjusting the overall color and intensity of the filter.


* *Opacity:* Sets the opacity of the color. Higher values will result in a more intense color tint.
* *Color:* Sets the color of the x-ray through the use of a standard color picker and defaults to blue.


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
