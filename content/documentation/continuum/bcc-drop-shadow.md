### **Overview**


The BCC Drop Shadow filter allows you to apply an animatable drop shadow to titles or clips in the timeline.

### **Function**


**Presets and Common Controls**


BCC filters come with a library of factory installed presets plus the ability to create your own custom presets and preview them with the BCC FX Browser™.


BCC filters also include common controls that configure global effect preferences and other host-specific effect settings.


For more information about working with presets and other common controls, [Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-common-controls/).

 


**Source Opacity:**sets the opacity of the source. For example, you can use this parameter to fade in a title, without fading in the shadow.


**Avoid Clipping Checkbox:**allows you to render shadows outside the source image.


* Warning: The Avoid Clipping Checkbox should be left on unless you need the output to stay at a constant size.


**Shadow Distance:**sets the distance (in pixels) between the shadow and the image.

| Shadow Distance=25 | Shadow Distance=150 |


**Shadow Intensity:**sets the opacity of the drop shadow, scaled as a percentage. At a value of 100, the shadow is completely opaque. Lower Shadow Intensity values make the background visible through the shadow. At a value of 0, the shadow is completely invisible.


**Shadow Angle:** sets the direction of the drop shadow. A setting of 0° places the shadow to the right of the image; a setting of 90° places it directly below the image.  

Shadow Color: sets the color of the shadow.


**Shadow Softness:** controls the softness of the edges of the shadows. A setting of 0 produces a sharply defined shadow with hard edges. Increasing Shadow Softness produces shadows with softer edges.


**The Blur Quality menu:** sets the quality of the Blur used to soften the shadow.


**Box**is the fastest option and is generally adequate. It produces a blur similar in quality to the BCC Blur filter. The remaining choices, *Low, Medium, High, Higher* and *Highest*produce soft shadows of increasing quality.  These options increase rendering times proportionately.


You can adjust the midlevel gray values of an image by adjusting the gamma. Increasing **Gamma** from the default of 100 lightens the shadows and reduces contrast. Decreasing Gamma darkens the shadows and increases contrast.
