NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021, the BCC Edge Cleaner filter gives users spatial and temporal control over keyed edges. Easily tackle compressed green screen footage that displays jittering edges around areas with fine detail such as hair. Edge Cleaner is available as an individual effect within the [Continuum Key & Blend Unit](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-units/key-and-blend/) and is also built-into [Primatte Studio](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/?collection=continuum-premium-filters&product=continuum-filter-primatte-studio). 


### **Parameter Controls**


**Presets and Common Controls**


BCC filters come with a library of factory installed presets plus the ability to create your own custom presets and preview them with the BCC FX Browser™. BCC filters also include common controls that configure global effect preferences and other host-specific effect settings. 


For more information about working with presets and other common controls, [Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-common-controls/).


**Compare Mode**


The BCC Compare Mode provides a convenient mechanism to compare the effect result with the original source layer. It provides several variations on basic split-screen views with the filtered clip placed next to the unedited original.


For more information on the Compare Mode,[Click Here](/documentation/continuum/bcc-compare-mode/).


**Cleaning Radius:** Adjusts the area of included pixels to be cleaned. 


**View Mode:** Allows for the selection of visible pixels to help refine the cleaning. Available modes are:


* *Normal*: displays the final output, and all pixels visible.
* *Alpha*: displays the alpha pixels only.
* *Guide*: Highlights alpha edge pixels
* **Prev Frame:** highlights alpha edge pixels from the previous frame.


**Temporal Smoothing:** Used to enable the smoothing of the filter result over time. 


**Alpha Contrast:** Adjusts the contrast between the alpha and non-alpha pixels for sharper resolution.


**Strength:** Adjusts the intensity of the edge cleaning.


**Edge Sensitivity:** adjust to discriminate between edge pixels and the overall image. Higher values will increase the sensitivity of edge pixel selection.


#### Mocha Pixelchooser


The BCC PixelChooser with built in Mocha motion tracking provides simple, built-in masking of the effect result.  The PixelChooser is generally used to select a portion of the image and restrict an effect to just the selected area while maintaining the original image content in unselected regions.  The selection can be based on geometric shapes or on the image’s luma/color properties.
