### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


#### Light


**Blend**: Determines the blend mode to be used to add the light.


* *Add*: The light is added to your image.
* *Screen*: The light is combined with the image using a Screen blend mode. This looks kind of like the Add blend mode, but highlights are retained.


**Brightness**: Sets the intensity of the light.


**Blur**: Sets the softness of the light.


**Gels**: Photographers, cinematographers and lighting designers use colored filters or gels in front of lights. Whatever mood you wish to create, we have the colors needed to achieve the effect. Select one of the Gels presets from the pop-up menu.


**Color**: Sets the color of the light through the use of a standard color picker.


#### Shadow


**Brightness**: Sets the intensity of the shadows. The Brightness parameter will darken only those areas that are not being brightened by the Light settings.


### Transform


#### Corner Pin


The eyelight position can be adjusted in the host with the **Corner Pin** sliders as well as dragging the four points on the corners of the screen.


**Note:**You may need to zoom the image out a bit to see the corner points. In addition, to see and adjust the corner points in *After Effects*, make sure that the effect title in the Effect Controls window is highlighted. For *Final Cut Pro*, you must activate the cross hair icon next to the corner position parameters to see and adjust the corner points on the screen.


* *Upper-Left:* Controls the X and Y position of the Upper Left Point.
* *Upper-Right:* Controls the X and Y position of the Upper Right Point.
* *Lower-Right:*Controls the X and Y position of the Lower Right Point.
* *Lower-Left:* Controls the X and Y position of the Lower Left Point.


#### Position


**Position**can be adjusted by clicking and dragging an on-screen control in the center of the image.


* *Position X:* The horizontal position.
* *Position Y:* The vertical position.


**Note:**For Final Cut Pro, you must activate the cross hair icon next to the Position parameter.


#### Scale


The **scale**of the image can be changed by adjusting the vertical and horizontal scale parameters.


* *Scale X:* The horizontal scale.
* *Scale Y*: The vertical scale.
* *Gang Scale:*The Scale X and Scale Y slider values can be ganged together. When enabled, the scale parameter will not display individual X and Y parameters.


#### Rotate


In addition to the standard position and scale controls, you can **rotate**. Positive values rotate *clockwise*and negative values rotate *counter-clockwise*.


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
