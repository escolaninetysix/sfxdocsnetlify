NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021.5, the BCC+ Flashing filter allows you to use photographic filters to lower the contrast of your shadows or highlights. The motion picture lab can expose a small amount of light to the film at various stages of the developing and printing process. For example, Negative plus Dupe Negative flashing lifts blacks, while Print plus Master Positive flashing softens whites.

### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


#### Shadows


**Brightness**: Raises the brightness of the shadows using either the Shadow > Color or Shadow > Presets.


**Presets**: Select one of the filters from the pop-up menu.


**Color**: The Color parameter sets the color of the flashing through the use of a standard color picker.


**Position**: Selects the shadow values to be adjusted.


**Range**: Controls the range of values to be used for the shadows. A higher Range value considers more values as shadows.


#### Highlights


**Brightness**: Lowers the brightness of the highlights using either the Highlights > Color or Highlights > Presets.


**Presets**: Select one of the filters from the pop-up menu.


**Color**: The Color parameter sets the color of the flashing through the use of a standard color picker.


**Position**: Selects the highlight values to be adjusted.


**Range**: Controls the range of values to be used for the highlights. A higher Range value considers more values as highlights. 


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
