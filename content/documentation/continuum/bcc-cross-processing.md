NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021, The BCC+ Cross Processing filter creates a photographic technique where print film (C41) is processed in the set of chemicals usually used to process slide film (E6) or vice versa. The final result yields images with oddly skewed colors and increased contrast and saturation. Different film stocks produce different results, so we have created what we feel is a representative look.

### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done. 


### Filter Parameters


**Amount:** Controls the strength of the Cross Processing filter.


**Curve Graph:** Allows you to make precise adjustments to the color and brightness of the image. NOTE: you will need to open the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to access this parameter.


**RGB:** Adjusts the Red, Green and Blue values in the image.


**Red:** Adjust the red values in the image.


**Green:** Adjusts the green values in the image.


**Blue:** Adjusts the blue values in the image.


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.
