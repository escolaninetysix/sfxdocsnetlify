NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021, the BCC+ Lens Flare filter adds photo-realistic lens flares to a scene. Lens flares are produced by the scattering or flaring of light within a lens when pointed into a bright light. Although an image aberration, lens flares can be added for dramatic effect and are created by combing the following elements: Caustic, Chroma Bands, Chroma Ring, Circle, Circles, Disc, Edge Streak, Ellipse, Fan Rays, Hot Spot, Polygon, Polygons, Radial Streaks, Random Spikes, Ring, Spikes, Spiral Rays, Star, Star Caustic, and Stripe.

### Presets and the FX Editor


The FX Editor provides a convenient way to store and retrieve factory installed and/or user generated filter presets. To select a preset, open the FX Editor interface and pick one from the Presets panel. Click the apply button in the [FX Editor](/documentation/continuum/bcc-fx-editor) to return to the host user interface. 


To save a custom preset, click the “Create Custom Preset” icon in the top right corner of the parameter list, next to the filter name, set a name for the new custom preset in the dialog that appears and click done.

#### Flare


**Input is Linear**: Enable this if your image is in true linear color space. Gamma corrected images should have this parameter disabled.


**Blend**: Determines the blend mode used to composite the lens flare.


* Add: The lens flare is added to your image.

**Pivot**: Changes the end position of the lens flare.


**Scale**: Determines the size.


**Aspect**: Sets the aspect ratio.

* *Amount*: Controls the amount of the edge flare.
* Size: Sets the size of the edge flare.


#### Noise


Adds noise to the lens flare elements. Noise can selectively be added to elements based on whether an element’s Lens Noise parameter is enabled. Alternatively, you can apply noise to all elements using the parameter below.


* *All Elements*: Applies the noise pattern to all lens flare elements.
* *Amount*: Sets the amount of the noise.

### Working with The Filter


1. Apply BCC+ Lens Flare from the BCC Lights unit category.
2. Click the BCC FX Editor button from the Effects and Presets banner. The FX Editor user interface opens and consists of Presets, Parameters and Viewer windows.
3. Try out some of the presets.
4. In the Presets window, choose a new preset group from the pop-up menu to see a different set of lens flare presets.
5. Click and drag the hot spot point control to move the origin of the lens flare. This is the Position control.
6. Click and drag the center point control to change the end position of the lens flare. This is the Pivot control.
7. Adjust the Color, Brightness, Scale and Angle as desired.If the lens flare is positioned towards the edge of the frame, you can use the Edge Flare controls to simulate the flaring of the light source as the flare enters or exists the frame.
8. Change the Edge Flare > Amount and Size and then move the lens flare towards the edge of the screen to see the effect.
9. Noise can be added to all elements by enabling Noise > All Elements and then setting the noise controls.


Note:To selectively add noise to a single element, you would enable the Lens Noise parameter within the Flare Editor for the desired element. See the next tutorial.


To edit lens flare elements, open the Flare Editor.


1. Click the Edit Flare button.The Flare Editor interface opens consisting of a Viewer, Parameters, Global, Flare (currently used flare elements) and Elements (all available elements).Note:The controls shown in the Global tab affect all elements. These are the same as those shown in the DFT interface prior to opening the Flare Editor.
