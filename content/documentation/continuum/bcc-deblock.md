NEW IN CONTINUUM 2021, The BCC+ DeBlock filter automatically assists in the removal of blocking artifacts created as a result of high compression factors.

### Filter Parameters


There are no controls for the DeBlock filter since it automatically finds blocks and removes them.


**PixelChooser:**  The BCC PixelChooser provides a way for the user to select which pixels in the filtered source are actually going to be affected by the filter, via the generation of image based mattes, gradient mattes and vector shape masks. Mocha planar tracking and vector shape masking options are included in the PixelChooser, which allows for the generation of motion-tracked mask shapes as a hold-back mask.

### Working with The Filter


1. Simply apply the filter to a clip and BCC+ DeBlock will automatically scan the image and remove blocking artifacts.
