 <p>
  <b>
   Known Issues:
  </b>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Resolve: PrismLens may render sharp edges in the Color tab when previewing the shape mask.
  </li>
  <li>
   PrismLens: May be slow in Flame.
  </li>
  <li>
   Not all S_UltraZap presets are visible in S_Effect
  </li>
  <li>
   Resolve: Aurora when used in the Color panel alone in Resolve on MacOS on Monterey with multiple GPUs, it sometimes crashes.
  It doesn't crash if a ChannelSwitcher node is added upstream.  Alternatively, host_gpu_integration can be turned off in s_config.
  </li>
  <li>
   Vegas: S_EFfect and S_Transition presets are not loading correctly.
  </li>
  <li>
   Resolve: The first time Sapphire is used after it's been installed, no Sapphire related dialogs will pop up.  This includes the Help Dialog, the Preset Browser, and the ColorFuse LUT chooser.  If Resolve is relaunched, the dialogs all work as normal.
  </li>
  <li>
   UltraZapMocha: Sometimes, a straight line will apear in the zap.  To fix this, add an additional control point in mocha in the part of the mocha spline that corresponds to that straight segment.  Adjust the control point until the straight line segment goes away.
  </li>
  <li>
   Sometimes Mocha tracks slowly.  If this happens, close mocha, re-open mocha, then play through the clip inside mocha.  After the clip is cached in mocha, tracking will proceed smoothly.  Sometimes if the clip is tracking slowly an "unable to track" error will also pop up.
  </li>
  <li>
   If Sapphire 2021.5 OFX is installed at the same time as 2021.0 (either AE or AVX), lensflare presets may not show up inside 2021.0.  To fix this, all Sapphire plugins installed on a single machine should be 2021.5.  If the second installation of Sapphire cannot be upgraded to 2021.5, the Sapphire 2021.0 plugins may be re-installed to restore the 2021.0 compatible LensFlare presets.
  </li>
  <li>
   Dongle Licenses are not currently supported on Mac M1 machines.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mac OS, Big Sur: if you open mocha and then open the preset browser, the preset browser will fail and generate an error.  If this happens, the host will have to be restarted to fix the preset browser.
  </li>
  <li>
   UltraZap: On an open spline zap may do unexpected things when mixing vary-endpoint and looping parameters.
  </li>
  <li>
   S_ZComp: The preset browser can't open unless an input is connected to the DepthB input.
  </li>
  <li>
   Deinterlace Auto fails to find a pattern on many clips.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mocha: The Mocha UI does not correctly locate the default OCIO config file shipped with Sapphire.  To use the default
    OCIO config file shipped with Sapphire, use the OCIO environment variable to locate said the config file.
  </li>
  <li>
   Resolve: Point widgets may respond slowly in Resolve after a Mocha point track has been created.
  </li>
  <li>
   Baselight: Sapphire 2022 does not work with Baselight on Centos 6.4.
  </li>
  <li>
   Vegas: Vegas will take a long time to start up the first time after installing Sapphire as Vegas generates a plugin cache.  Subsequent launches will be faster.

  <a name="compat-notes">
   Compatibility Notes:
  </a>
 </h3>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Sapphire 2022 has been updated to use CUDA 11 in order to support NVIDIA's latest Ampere cards. (RTX A4000, A5000, and A6000).
  As a result some cards from 2012 are no longer supported.  Sapphire 2022 works with CUDA compute capability 3.5 and higher.
  </li>
  <li>
   LensFlare: A bug was fixed in Sapphire 2022 in LensFlare, where the saturdation parameter inside the plugin didn't
  apply correctly to all elements.  Fixing this means that some elements will look different in 2022 if saturation is set to
  a value different than 1.0.
  </li>
  <li>
   In v2019, LensFlares using MutliSpot and MultiStreak elements would look different
  inside the Flare Designer across operating systems.  In v2019.5 this was fixed,
  but as a result LensFlares may look different from v2019 when loaded through the Flare
  Designer.  Old projects will continue to look the same as they did in v2019 when loaded
  into the host or rendered, but may look different after loading in the Flare Designer.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>
  <a name="opencolorio">
   Color Management with OpenColorIO
  </a>
 </h3>
 OpenColorIO (OCIO), is the open-source color management solution from
Sony Picture Imageworks, Sapphire 2020 can apply and read a color profile
to provide consistent colors across internal applications, such as the
Preset Browser, Flare Designer, and Effect and Transition Builder. The
Flare Designer and Builder applications now feature an OCIO panel to
confidently manage the color output to any monitor. Also, Sapphire 2020
features a new effect called S_OCIOTransform, which allows Sapphire to
apply an OCIO transform inside of any application, bringing OCIO Color
Management to many applications that have yet to adopt the OCIO standard.
 <p>
  All OpenColorIO information below applies both to Color Management within
  the Sapphire Preset Browser, Sapphire Effect and Transition Builder, and Sapphire
  Flare Designer as well as to the new OCIOTransform effect in Sapphire 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  To use OpenColorIO in Sapphire, there are three ways to specify the OpenColorIO configuration file.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   By default, Sapphire will use the config.ocio file found in Sapphire's installation directory.
  </li>
  <li>
   To set OCIO system wide, set the OCIO environment variable to point to the desired config.ocio.
  This will ensure that all host applications and plugins that use OCIO will use the same OCIO settings.
   <ul>
    <li>
     We strongly suggest working with an IT department or IT professional to help setup environment
    variables, as there can be underlying conflicts with pre-existing settings.
    </li>
    <li>
     Windows:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Open "File Explorer"
      </li>
      <li>
       Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties"
      </li>
      <li>
       On the left, navigate to "Advanced system settings"
      </li>
      <li>
       At the bottom, click on "Environment Variables"
      </li>
      <li>
       In the top section labelled "User variables for...", click "New"
      </li>
      <li>
       In the dialog that pops up, enter "OCIO" in the "Variable name" box,
  and the full path to the config.ocio file in the "Variable value" box.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Mac OS:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Open a Terminal - This can be found using Spotlight
      </li>
      <li>
       Type: "launchctl setenv OCIO /full/macos/pathway/config.ocio" (without quotes).
    Note: this will not remain set after a reboot.
      </li>
      <li>
       To set the environment variable so that it persists through a reboot, the above command
    needs to be called through a .plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Linux:
     <ul>
      <li>
       To set the OCIO environment variable for all users of the computer, add
    "export OCIO /full/linux/pathway/config.ocio" (without quotes) to /etc/profile,
    replacing "full/linux/pathway/config.ocio" with the path full path
    for the desired config.ocio.
      </li>
      <li>
       To set the OCIO environment variable for the current user only, add
    "export OCIO /full/linux/pathway/config.ocio" (without quotes) to ~/.profile,
    replacing "/full/linux/pathway/config.ocio" with the path full path
    for the desired config.ocio.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   To set OCIO for Sapphire only, set the ocio_config flag inside the s_config
  file that shipped with Sapphire and can be found in the Sapphire installation
  directory.

 <h3>
  <a name="load-plugin">
   Loading a Plug-in
  </a>
 </h3>
 When Sapphire Plug-ins have been installed and the host application
has been restarted, the new plug-ins should appear in the host
application's effects menus just like any other effects.
 <p>
  On Nuke: click on the Boris FX Sapphire icon in the toolbar on the
left-hand side of the screen.  Select the desired Sapphire effects
category, and click on an effect to add it to your project.
Alternatively, you can right-click anywhere the Node Graph window and
go to Sapphire -&gt; Sapphire Category Name -&gt; Effect Name in the context
menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Fusion: in the Tools menu, select Sapphire and the desired Sapphire
effects category, then click on an effect to add it to your
Composition.  Alternatively, you can right-click directly in the Comp
Window and select Add Tool -&gt; Sapphire -&gt; Sapphire Category Name -&gt;
Effect Name.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Baselight: using the Insert Menu, select the OFX Filter menu
and select the desired Sapphire effects category.  Then click on an
effect to apply it to the currently selected clip.  Instead of using
the OFX Filter menu, you can alternatively use the OFX Transition menu
to select amongst only transitions, or the OFX Source menu to select
just generators.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <h3>
  <a name="preset-browser">
   Browsing and Selecting Presets
  </a>
 </h3>
 You can load and save presets for effects using the
 <b>
  Load Preset
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  Save Preset
 </b>
 buttons near the top of the effect control
window in all Sapphire effects.
 <h4>
  Loading:
 </h4>
 In the preset browser you'll see all the presets available for the
current plug-in, both Boris FX-supplied presets and the ones you've
created yourself.  You can filter by tags on the left side to quickly
find the look you're interested in.
 <p>
  The main top window shows the preset on your footage (unless the
plug-in can't access the AE layer for some reason, in which case
you'll see a poster frame) and various information about the preset.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the bottom you see all the presets; you can enlarge or shrink them
with the slider at the bottom.  You can also switch to a table view
there, as well as viewing the preset on your source, over black, or
over the sample footage.  You can also see the source all by itself
for comparison.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Saving:
 </h4>
 Clicking
 <b>
  Save Preset
 </b>
 brings up the Save Preset dialog.  Here
you can name the preset, and add various other information.
Particularly important is the tagging system; you can apply as many
tags as you want to your presets.  You can even create new tags.  Tags
are grouped into categories, so all the color names appear under
Colors, for instance.
 <p>
  You can create new categories as well, by typing into the Category
drop-down menu after clicking Add New Tag....  Boris FX recommends
sticking to the shipped categories when possible, for compatibility.
But adding your own tags within categories (new color names, for
example) is encouraged.
 </p>
 <h4>
  More Info:
 </h4>
 <p>
  While the preset browser, save dialog, or flare designer are open, the
main AE window will be unresponsive.  This is normal.  Close the
preset browser or flare designer and AE will wake up again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certain parameters, like Lens Flare hotspot, are not saved in presets;
we thought it would be less than useful for the flares to jump around
as you load presets.
 </p>
 <p>
  It may take a few seconds to load the preset browser if a plug-in has
many presets.  Be patient.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Preset Browser has a "Use Static Thumbnails" checkbox in certain effects.
When checked, the thumbnails use a pre-rendered image to improve performance.
If "Use Static Thumbnails" is not checked, the thumbnails will render on the
footage the Sapphire effect has been applied to back in the host.
 </p>
 <p>
  If playing through the preview window in the Preset Browser, Flare Editor, or
Effect Builder, is using too much memory, "Render on Still" is available
in the view menu.  This will reduce the memory usage of the preview window
by rendering all frames using the same host frame.
 </p>
 <p>
  The preset browser may be configured to load presets from and/or save presets
to user specified locations.  The load location and save location may be
different.  If the locations are different, load will show presets from both the load
location and the save location.  Save will only use the specified save location.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three options for setting the load and save paths:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   To set load and save paths per user, use the "Browser Settings" dialog.  To do this:
  open the preset browser, go to the Edit menu and select "Browser Settings".
  </li>
  <li>
   To set the load and save paths for all users of the machine, use the INI file.  To do this, edit the
    sapphire-app-settings.ini file in the Sapphire directory:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Windows: C:\Program Files\BorisFX\Sapphire 2023 OFX\sapphire-app-settings.ini
    </li>
    <li>
     MacOS: /Applications/BorisFX/Sapphire 2023 OFX/config/sapphire-app-settings.ini
    </li>
    <li>
     Linux: /opt/BorisFX/SapphireOFX/sapphire-app-settings.ini
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   To set the load and save paths in a script, use the Sapphire environment variables:
  SAPPHIRE_LOAD_PRESET_PATH and SAPPHIRE_SAVE_PRESET_PATH.
  </li>
 </ol>
 Note: Values set in environment variables will override the INI file.  Values set in the "Browser Settings"
dialog will override both.

 <h3>
  <a name="flare-editor">
   Editing and Designing Lens Flares and
other elements
  </a>
 </h3>
 Clicking
 <b>
  Edit Lens
 </b>
 in LensFlare, or
 <b>
  Edit Style
 </b>
 in Glare
or Flashbulbs, opens up the Lens Flare Designer.
 <p>
  The Flare Designer lets you completely customize a lens flare.  You
can add or remove elements, copy them, customize how each element
looks, and even how it reacts to the center or edge of the image.  You
can also interactively move the flare around to see how it will look
as it moves.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the panels of the Flare Designer are movable, so you can adjust
the user interface itself to suit your work flow.  The main panels are
the view window, where you see the flare you're working on, the
Elements panel which lists all the elements of the flare, and the
Properties panel, which lets you adjust the properties of the
currently selected element (or elements).  There's also a toolbar of
element templates at the top.
 </p>
 <h4>
  View Panel
 </h4>
 The main view window is where you see how your flare will look; you
can click and drag to move the flare around.  You can see it over the
background or just over black, adjust the gamma, and Solo only the
selected elements.
 <b>
  Use Plug-in Settings
 </b>
 makes the flare
designer import the plug-in settings currently active in the host
app.  If you have that selected, the flare will look the same back in
the host app when you're done designing it.  On the other hand, if you
want to create a "reusable" flare preset, it's probably a good idea to
un-check Use Plug-in Settings so the flare will look good with default
settings in the plug-in.
 <h4>
  Elements Panel
 </h4>
 The Elements panel shows you all the elements, with thumbnails.  If
you mouse over them, an overlay shows where they are in the main view
window.  When you click on an element to select it, it also flashes
brighter in the main window to help you find the element you're
looking for.  Clicking
 <b>
  Identify
 </b>
 in the Properties panel does
the same flashing.
 <p>
  To add new elements, just click the element template picture in the
top toolbar.  You can then rename the element, move it in the list by
dragging and dropping, or hide it by un-checking the checkbox.
 </p>
 <p>
  To delete an elements, select it and click the trash can icon at the
bottom of the Elements panel, or click Delete.  There is full undo, so
feel free to experiment!
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also duplicate an element using standard copy/paste
operations, or select it and click the two pages icon at the bottom of
the Elements panel.  You can then adjust the copy's parameters in the
Parameters panel.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gear-looking element is the "advanced element" type; it has lots
of controls and is very customizable, but it's recommended for
advanced users only.  The other types get you most of the same looks
with simpler parameters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with all the standard element types, you can import your own
images to use as elements.  Click the picture frame to import an image
file.  The image data will become part of the flare, so it doesn't
need to keep a reference to the original file.
 </p>
 <p>
  To combine two flares into one, or add many elements at once, you can
import another flare into your current flare; this will add all the
other flare's elements to your current flare.  You can also just open
that flare, which replaces your current flare with that one.  To
import and add to your flare, use Insert Flare (down-right pointing
arrow in the toolbar), or File... Insert Flare.  To import and
replace, use Open Flare (folder icon in the toolbar), or use
File... Open Flare.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Parameters Panel
 </h4>
 The Parameters panel is where you adjust all the details of a single
element -- or multiple elements together, if you select multiple
elements in the Elements panel.  (Use Shift-click or Control-click to
select multiple elements.)
 <p>
  There are a few common control types.  Sliders with numbers to the
left control numeric params; you can drag the slider thumb, but you
can also drag in the number text field to increase or decrease the
value.  You can also click in the number field and type any value you
want.
 </p>
 <p>
  Color controls are just a swatch of color; click to bring up a
standard color picker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some elements have a Gradient; there's a special gradient control to
adjust those.  The stops are below the color swatch; you can drag them
left and right to move them.  Drag down to delete.  Click in the color
gradient to add a stop there.  Control-drag to "stretch" neighboring
colors, and shift-drag to push neighboring colors.  The triangles
above the color gradient allow you to control the interpolation of the
colors between stops.  Ring Thickness lets you easily turn a spot or
fan of rays into a ring; turning Ring Thickness down from 1 hollows
out the center.  This lets you still have fine control of the colors
within the ring, even if it's very thin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Different element types will have various parameters you can adjust,
but here are some common ones:
 </p>
 <dl>
  <dt>
   Position
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Where the element occurs, along the line between the hotspot and
  pivot point.  Position 1.0 is at the hotspot, 0.0 is at the pivot.
  Note that you don't have to stay in that range; you can use any
  value you like.  Bigger than 1 will be past the hotspot, and less
  than zero will look like a reflection because it's on the other side
  of the pivot point.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Size
  </dt>
  <dd>
   How big the image is.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Rel Width, Rel Height
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Use these to squash and stretch.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Rotate
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Rotates the element around, in degrees.
  </dd>
 </dl>
 There's a Reset button at the bottom of the Parameters panel to reset
the current element(s) to all default settings.  That's undoable too.
 <h4>
  More Information
 </h4>
 If you open the flare designer from the plug-in, you can just click OK
to close the window when you're done; your current flare will be used
in your project and saved with it.  But you can do more than that; you
can save the flare definition to disk separately, so you can recall it
later, or use it in other flares.  You can also open the flare
designer directly from the Start menu or Applications folder to create
flares independent of your host product.  In this case, use
File...Save Lens As... to save the flare definition.   That dialog
will allow you to name the lens and tag it so it's easy to find later.
 <p>
  Note that saving a lens this way does
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  save your plug-in
settings; it only saves the lens flare definition itself (the things
you can change in the flare designer).  You can save a preset in the
host application to save everything -- the flare and all the regular
plug-in parameters.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the preset browser, save dialog, or flare designer are open, the
main AE window will be unresponsive.  This is normal.  Close the
preset browser or flare designer and AE will wake up again.

 <h3>
  <a name="mocha">
   Using Mocha in Sapphire
  </a>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What is Mocha?
 </h4>
 <p>
  Mocha is a planar tracking and masking utility that can save time on
the most difficult motion tracking and masking shots. It tracks the
entire area of the mask, not just individual points, to significantly
reduce the tedium of manual keyframing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mocha looks for 3-d planes in the image: pixels that move together.
Screens and signs are clear candidates, but Mocha can also track
faces. It can handle objects obscured by foreground elements, and can
track unlimited layers all at once.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's a lot more to Mocha than we can explain here; there are plenty
of tutorials online at http://borisfx.com.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Sapphire, Mocha works as a mask for the effect, similarly to the
mask input, but with all the tracking features of Mocha. For instance,
in S_DistortRGB, the mask affects the amount of RGB distortion. In
S_Glow, the mask masks out the areas you want to emit glowing light,
without chopping off the smooth edges of the glow.
 </p>
 <h4>
  How to use it
 </h4>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Apply a Sapphire effect
  </li>
  <p>
   Most Sapphire effects now feature Mocha planar tracking integrated
within the effect. Certain effects were omitted because utilizing a
mask made no logical sense; for example, none of the S_Transition
effects incorporate S_Mocha, and the Z_effects which require a Z_depth
matte to work were also skipped.
  </p>
  <li>
   Click
   <b>
    Edit Mocha
   </b>
   to launch Mocha
  </li>
  <p>
   When you click the
   <b>
    Edit Mocha
   </b>
   button, you will launch the Mocha UI,
which will allow you to create and track a mask for use back with the
selected Sapphire effect in your host application.
  </p>
  <li>
   Create a spline
  </li>
  <p>
   You can create a shape to track within Mocha utilizing either an
X-spline or Bezier splines. X-splines are recommended for most uses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Draw one or more splines around the planar areas you would like to
track.
  </p>
  <li>
   Track it
  </li>
  <p>
   You can use backwards and forward tracking from whatever frame you're
parked on. You can often get a great result with default settings, but
if you're getting a lot of drifts, try increasing the
   <b>
    Min K Pixels Used
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <li>
   Save and exit back to host
  </li>
  <p>
   For your mask to appear back in your host application, YOU MUST SAVE
AND EXIT. If you exit without saving, all you current work will
be lost. Always save and exit!
  </p>
  <li>
   Adjust in Sapphire
  </li>
  <p>
   You can make additional fine tuning adjustments after tracking in
Mocha by opening the "Mocha" pulldown in your selected Sapphire
effect. Additional softness and position/scale paramters can be
found here, as well as checkboxes for soloing/hiding/inverting the
Mocha mask.
  </p>
  <li>
   Moving masks between effects
  </li>
  <p>
   Sometimes you track a shot with Mocha in one Sapphire effect and would
like to reuse the track in a different effect. The simplest way is to
export it from the first effect and re-import into the second effect.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    go into Mocha with
    <b>
     Edit Mocha
    </b>
    , then File &gt; Export to
  export the Mocha project to a file.
   </li>
   <li>
    Exit Mocha and delete the old effect.
   </li>
   <li>
    Apply the new effect,
    <b>
     Edit Mocha

   Alternatively, if you want to share a Mocha mask with several effects,
track the mask in a simple Sapphire effect such as S_HueSatBright. In
there, select
   <b>
    Show Mocha Only
   </b>
   . Then use that as the Mask input
to the effects where you want the mask used. (Exactly how to do this
varies with host app.) Since the Mocha mask acts just like a regular
mask input, this will allow you to update the mask once and all the
other effects will use it.

 <h3>
  <a name="gpu">
   GPU Acceleration
  </a>
 </h3>
 Many effects can use the
GPU to speed up rendering. This requires an NVIDIA graphics card which
supports CUDA, such as a GeForce 280 or 285, or Quadro FX 5600 or
5800. If a suitable GPU is found, a GPU Enable button will appear in
the Help dialog.  GPU acceleration is enabled by default if it's
available, but if you experience performance or stability problems,
you can turn it off by deselecting the GPU Enable button.
 <p>
  If a plug-in is unable to render on the GPU, it will automatically
fall back to the CPU and continue processing. The GPU status,
including the type of error, is displayed in the Help dialog.
 </p>
 <p>
  On machines with more than one GPU that supports CUDA, you can select which
GPU Sapphire Plug-ins will use by changing the value of use_gpu in the
  <tt>
   s_config.text
  </tt>
  file.

 <h3>
  <a name="motion-blur">
   About Motion Blur
  </a>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Many Sapphire Plug-ins can simulate motion blur by rendering the
effect at multiple times and averaging the results together. Motion
blur is controlled by three parameters:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <b>
    Enable Motion Blur
   </b>
   turns motion blur on or off.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>
    Shutter Angle
   </b>
   controls the amount of time that the
  simulated shutter is open, and thus the overall amount of motion
  blur.  The default value of 180 degrees will blur over an interval
  of half a frame, which is a common setting for real cameras. A value
  of 360 degrees will blur over an entire frame, which is the maximum
  amount of motion blur possible with a real camera. Values above 360
  degrees will produce unrealistic results in which the motion of
  adjacent frames overlaps.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>
    Samples
   </b>
   controls the number of individual renders that are
  averaged together. Increasing the number of samples will give
  smoother results, but will also increase render times. If too few
  samples are used, there can be visible aliasing or ghosting
  artifacts. Faster motion will require more samples to avoid
  artifacts.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>
  <a name="matte">
   About Mask Inputs
  </a>
 </h3>
 Many Sapphire Plug-ins accept an optional Mask input clip.
Typically, this input can be used to provide more detailed control for
where the effect should be applied and where it should not be applied.
 <p>
  <a href="../glint">
   Glint
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="../glow">
   Glow
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="../glare">
   Glare
  </a>
  ,
and
  <a href="../rays">
   Rays
  </a>
  ,
for example, take the main Source
input and also an optional Mask input.  For these, the source input
is multiplied by the mask
  <i>
   before
  </i>
  generating the glints (or
glows, glares), so where the mask is black no glints are generated,
and where it is white they are generated as usual.  This method
prevents the glints or glows themselves from being partially cropped
by the mask.  In addition these effects use the RGB colors of the
Mask input to selectively colorize the resulting glows, glints, or
glares.  The red areas of the mask will produce red glows, glints, or
glares, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <a href="../blur">
   Blur
  </a>
  effects, the areas which are masked out
are never blurred, so they do not blur into the masked-in regions.  If
a mask were instead applied afterward, the pixels behind the mask
would be blurred over the edge of the mask and into the final image.
As an example, say you have a clip with white text over a black
background.  If you put that clip into both the Source and Mask
inputs of Blur, the black background will
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  be blurred into
the text, since the black pixels are all masked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some OFX host products, such as Toxik and Fusion, have their own
native masking inputs on every effect.  These inputs simply composite
the original source over the normal result where the mask is black.
The plug-in doesn't use that input in its processing.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Fusion, the native masking input is called Effect Mask and it's
blue to distinguish it from the Sapphire Mask input, which is white.
In Toxik, the native Masking input is always last and is colored
black, whereas the Sapphire Mask input is gray like other inputs.
 </p>

 <h3>
  <a name="alpha">
   About Alpha Channel Processing
  </a>
 </h3>
 All Sapphire Plug-ins can handle RGBA inputs, and the Alpha of RGBA
inputs is handled in one of three ways, depending on the effect:
 <ol>
  <p>
  </p>
  <li>
   Alpha is processed as just another input channel like R, G, and
B.  Effects in this category include: AutoPaint, Mosaic, Blur,
BlurMotion, RackDefocus, all Wipes, all Dissolves, Distort, DistortBlur,
DistortChroma, all Kaleidoscopes, all Warps, Shake, and MathOps.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Alpha is copied from the first input to the output.  In this
case the effect doesn't use the Alpha channel, but it is passed
through unchanged from the first input to the output.  Effects in this
category include: BandPass, BlurChroma, ClampChroma, DuoTone,
EdgeDetect, Embosses, Etching, HalfTones, Hotspots, DistortRGB,
Monochrome, Pseudo_Color, Psykos, Sharpen, Sketch, Sparkles, Streaks,
Threshold, and Zebrafy.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Some other effects pass the input Alpha channel through, and
also add some opacity where the effects are applied.  An Affect Alpha
parameter is included in these effects which allows adjusting the
amount that the alpha channel is affected.  The effects in this
category are: LensFlare, all Glows, all Glints, Glare, EdgeRays, Rays,
and all Zaps.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Some OFX host products, such as Nuke and Fusion, represent RGBA images
in pre-multiplied format, where the RGB are assumed to be scaled by
the opacity.  Other hosts such as Toxik, Baselight, and Film Master
represent RGBA in non-premultiplied or straight format.  Sapphire
effects use pre-multiplied format internally, and will automatically
convert as needed depending on the host product's format.  The Affect
Alpha parameter which is available in most lighting effects tends to
be less necessary in hosts that use pre-multiplied RGBA format, and it
defaults to 0.0 for these hosts, but defaults to 1.0 for hosts that
use straight RGBA format.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <h3>
  <a name="pixel-aspect">
   About Pixel Aspect Ratios
  </a>
 </h3>
 For some image formats, the digital form of the image is scaled
non-uniformly to produce the final viewed picture.  For example NTSC
resolution is normally 720x486 with an aspect ratio of 1.481.
However, the final NTSC picture has an aspect ratio of 4/3 or 1.333.  Thus
the original digital image is scaled in the horizontal direction by a
factor of 0.9 and shapes rendered as circles can end up squashed
slightly into ovals.  The original pixels are effectively rectangular
shaped instead of squares, and have an aspect ratio of 1.481/1.333 =
1.111.  (Or 1.333/1.481 = 0.9 if the inverse ratio is used.)
 <p>
  OFX allows you to adjust the pixel aspect ratio in the
Composition Settings menu, and Sapphire Plug-ins read this value to
give the appropriately scaled results.
 </p>
 <p>
  If necessary, you can override the pixel aspect ratio for
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  Sapphire Plug-ins by changing the value of force_pixel_aspect_ratio in
the
  <tt>
   s_config.text
  </tt>
  file.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pixel aspect ratio makes no difference for basic pixel processing
effects such as color processing or compositing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <h3>
  <a name="custom">
   Customizing Plug-ins
  </a>
 </h3>
 A number of parameters are available that can be adjusted to customize
the behavior of all Sapphire plug-ins.  You can disable
multi-processing, force the
pixel aspect ratio, or specify lookup tables for more accurate
processing of log format images.
A facility is also included with
Sapphire Plug-ins that allows users with some programming experience
to define and customize new plug-ins.  For additional information on
these, or to modify a parameter, see the
 <tt>
  s_config.text
 </tt>
 file.
 <p>
  On Mac the config file is:
  <tt>
   /Applications/BorisFX/Sapphire 2023 OFX/config/s_config.text
  </tt>
  <br/>
  On Windows the config file is:
  <tt>
   C:\Program Files\BorisFX\Sapphire 2023 OFX\s_config.text
  </tt>
  .
  <br/>
  On Linux the config file is:
  <tt>
   /opt/BorisFX/SapphireOFX/s_config.text
  </tt>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Custom Lens Flare types can also be made by editing the
  <tt>
   s_lensflares.text
  </tt>
  file, in the same directory as the config
file above.  New flare types will automatically appear in the menu of
the S_LensFlare plug-in.

 <ol>
  <li>
   Resolve: Several effects don't blur correctly in Resolve.  We've identified
      the issue and are working with Blackmagic to fix the problem.
      The list of effects and parameters with this issue are:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Motion Blur in FilmRoll
    </li>
    <li>
     Motion Blur in StripSlideTranition

    <li>
     Motion Blur in WhipLash
    </li>
    <li>
     Blur as a result of Z-Dist, Shift, or Rotate in BlurMotionCurves
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Trimming clips from the head may invalidate the Mocha track.
  </li>
  <li>
   Any S_Effect saved with an earlier version containing WarpDrops
  will render incorrectly after installing Sapphire 11. The effect can
  be fixed by clicking "Edit Effect" to open Builder, and then
  clicking "OK" to update the effect to Sapphire 11.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mocha tracking in Resolve is only supported in Resolve 14 Studio
    and Resolve 12.5 Studio, not the free versions.
  </li>
  <li>
   Nuke: Mocha mask creation on effects connected to generators
  (color wheel, checkerboard etc.) only works if you move the playhead
    to the end of the generator clip.
  </li>
  <li>
   Vegas Studio Pro: Mocha mask creation in an effect applied as
    "Insert generated media" works, but frame numbers look too large in
    Mocha. However when exiting Mocha, the animated mask has the proper
    speed and duration.
  </li>
  <li>
   Vegas Studio Pro: Mocha UI will always start at the beginning of
  the clip, regardless of where the playhead is in the host.
  </li>
  <li>
   Silhouette: Mocha tracking is not supported
  </li>
  <li>
   In LensFlareAutoTrack the hotspot may move around if the resolution
    changes and the hotspot_shift parameter is set to any value other than zero.
    If using the hotspot_shift parameter always work in full resolution.
  </li>
  <li>
   Baselight: Mocha tracking will appear to work in the UI, but rendering will fail.
