==== Node-Locked License Troubleshooting

. If your computer or server is not connected to the Internet (or you are running an older version of our software that does not use activation codes) you will not be able to activate your software using an activation code. Connect to the Internet or contact support for a manual license if connecting to the Internet is impossible. You will need to provide your Host ID. You will have to contact support to activate older, legacy versions of our software whether you have an Internet connection or not. Please follow the steps outlined in "Email Request Node-Locked Licenses" to get up and running as fast as possible.
. It is important that your mocha software matches your activation code, so check your purchase order to make sure everything matches up version wise. It may be that you don’t have the correct version of mocha installed from our download section. This is especially important for legacy software. The usual error for the wrong software or incorrect license for the software you are trying to run is “FLEXlm error: -15 No such feature exists.”
. If you are not running as the administrator of the machine, try running in admin mode and install again.
. If you are attempting to install via a terminal instead of directly on the machine itself and you are having trouble getting mocha to install, try installing directly on the machine.
. You may not have more than one license installed in your licensing folder. Make sure you only have one license installed on the machine. Licensing folders are as listed below:
	* License Directory for OSX:
		- /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses/
	* License Directory for Windows
		- Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\
		- Windows Vista: C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\
		- Windows 7: C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\
		- (Legacy versions of Imagineer Software may still use the directory C:\Program Files\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\)
	* License Directory for Linux
		- /etc/opt/isl/licences/
. Check to make sure you are not restricted to using certain ports due to a firewall or other admin permissions. When in doubt, temporarily turn your firewalls off for the duration of the installation and then turn them back on when you are done.
. Troubleshoot your machine; try uninstalling all your mocha software, restarting your machine, and installing the software again from scratch, and make sure you follow installation directions off our website exactly. It sounds redundant, but sometimes it’s a great way to figure out what is going on inside your machine.
. If all else fails, our support team is happy to help you figure this out. Please contact support here.

==== Email Request Node-Locked Licenses

If you are running older versions of the software or cannot connect to the internet, you have an alternate choice to activate your license.

. Run mocha and choose "Activate" from the welcome screen (See screen above). If you are running an older version you will need to choose "View License" from the Help menu.
. Go to https://borisfx.com/support/open-a-case/
. Fill out your contact information correctly
. Enter your purchase order number and postcode
. Enter or paste the Host Id (your MAC address) from the mocha Activation screen
. Confirm your version of mocha (this will speed up our turnaround and any troubleshooting).
. Submit.  You will then be sent an email containing your license within 24-48 hours from our support team. You will almost always receive your license sooner, but large volumes of support requests take time to process.
. Check your spam folder if you have not received your license within 24-48 hours.
. Save this license to the Imagineer Systems license directory. If the directory does not exist you will need to create it.  See license directories below for further information.
	* License Directory for OSX:
		- /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses/
	* License Directory for Windows
		- Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\
		- Windows Vista: C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\
		- Windows 7: C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\
		- (Legacy versions of Imagineer Software may still use the directory C:\Program Files\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\)
	* License Directory for Linux
		- /etc/opt/isl/licences/


== Installing Floating Licenses
This guide will walk you through the process of installing floating licenses. Installing node-locked licenses does not require the use of the license manager. See above.

=== Floating licenses - How it works
Because many work environments have a dynamic structure, Imagineer Systems offer floating licenses. This works by keeping the license file on a central server, which can then be used by multiple client machines. For example, if your studio has 20 machines but you only need 5 people using our software at a time, you could get a 5-machine floating license, which can then be used on any 5 machines in your network. The software can then be installed on all 20 machines without needing individual licenses for each computer. When someone stops using the software on one machine, it then frees up that license spot for another machine on the network to use.

=== How do I install the floating license server?
Floating licenses can be complex to set up, and if you have no previous experience of configuring network services, the process can be quite daunting. If you need any help, please contact support (/support/open-a-case/) However, you may find a solution to your problem faster if you scroll down to troubleshooting below.
NOTE: To configure a license server you must have Administrator (or root) privileges

	* Windows 7: C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

=== Installing Floating Licenses on Linux

==== Linux License Manager

If you have received an activation code you will need to use the license manager to activate your license. If you received your license file by e-mail, proceed to the "Linux License Server" section below.

. Download the Linux license manager from the download section: http://imagineersystems.com/download/current-version-downloads/
. Make sure you have downloaded the correct version for your system. 64-bit versions of the software will not run on a 32-bit version of Linux.
. Double-click the RPM file to begin installation or install it from the terminal using sudo rpm -Uvh [PACKAGE_FILE].rpm, where [PACKAGE_FILE] is the name of the License Manager RPM file you have downloaded.

==== Linux License Server

To configure a license server as a service, you must have root privileges. We support license server installation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 32-bit systems, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 64 bit systems, and their equivalents.

. You should have already installed the Linux License Manager in the steps outlined above.
. After installing the License Manager, load it and use your activation code to activate
+
image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_linux_pre-activation.jpg["Linux License Manager",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_linux_pre-activation.jpg"]
+
. Press the Install Server License button in the License Manager to install the license to the server.
+
image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_linux_post-activation.jpg["Linux License Manager",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_linux_post-activation.jpg"]
+
. The manager will install the license file here: /etc/opt/isl/licences
. If you have requested to receive your license by e-mail, copy your License file (e.g. mocha.lic) into /etc/opt/isl/licences. Skip this step if you have used your activation code to install the server license instead.
. The server process should already be started automatically, but you can make sure by typing: /etc/init.d/isllmgrd start
. The server will start automatically at runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5. FLEXlm messages are logged to: /var/log/isllmgrd.log
. The init script accepts start, stop, restart and status commands, and also reread, which rereads the License file. The daemon is run by default as the nobody user. If this does not exist on your system, either create it or edit the script to use a different non-root user.

==== Linux Client Machine

Once you have the server license installed, you can then install mocha on your client machine and activate.

. Click on Activate on the welcome screen in mocha
. Using the same activation code, paste this into the Activation field and click Activate
. The client license should now install to: /etc/opt/isl/licences
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

==== Linux Client Machine (Manual Install)

Once you have the server license installed, you can then install mocha on your client machine.

. If you received your license by e-mail skip to point 5
. Open the Linux License Manager
. Submit your Activation Code and click on Show Detail
. Click generate client license and the file will save as client_license.lic
. The client license should be installed to: /etc/opt/isl/licences
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

==== Troubleshooting Floating Licenses

As with any software, problems may arise during the installation process. Please take a moment to read our troubleshooting section and check for common errors. You may also want to check out the "License Administration Guide" FLEXlm documentation PDF here:
http://www.globes.com/support/fnp_utilities_download.htm

If you continue to have issues installing, please contact support and we will be happy to help you. You may contact our support team here: https://borisfx.com/support/open-a-case/


===== Verify your server license has been successfully installed
Check that your license actually exists on the Server

*Mac OS X:*  /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses/mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Windows XP:*  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Windows Vista:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Windows 7:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Linux:*  /etc/opt/isl/licences/mocha_Pro_cross-platform_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic


===== Verify your client license has been successfully installed
Check that your client license actually exists on the client machine

*Mac OS X:*  /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses/mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Windows XP:*  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Windows Vista:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Windows 7:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Linux:*  /etc/opt/isl/licences/mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic


===== Verify you are using the latest version of the license server software.
Check http://imagineersystems.com/download/current-version-downloads/to make sure your License Manager is up to date.
Sometimes there can be issues where a 64-bit version of the server software has been installed on a 32-bit version of Windows. If this is the case, uninstall the License Manager then go to the downloads section of our website and download the correct bit version of the License Manager for your version of Windows. When in doubt, 32-bit should work.


===== Verify the SERVER port is not being used or blocked by another process
By default the license server runs in port 27000, but this can be blocked or used by other processes. You may see a TCP error in your server log file when it cannot read the port.

Check that ports 27000-27009 are open and not in use, or allocate a different port by editing the SERVER line in the license file:

[source, log]
----
SERVER servername 000000000000
----
to

[source, log]
----
SERVER servername 000000000000 12345
----

where 000000000000 is the host id and 12345 is a port chosen by the system administrator.


===== Verify there is not a firewall running between the server and the client computer
If your organization needs to run a firewall, you will need to open the ports of the license server manually. Normally the license server runs in port 27000, but if other FLEXnet license servers are present it may take a different port. To be safe, open ports 27000-27009. Also, the vendor daemon uses a port specified at run time. If a static port allocation is required, edit the license file and change:

[source, log]
----
VENDOR isl
----
to

[source, log]
----
VENDOR isl PORT=12345
----

where 12345 is a port chosen by the system administrator. Ideal port numbers are in the range of 49152 to 65535.


===== The client is receiving an error of -15 or -96

This means the server is not running correctly or there is a network problem between two computers. Please follow the steps below:

. Open the License Manager
. Switch to the Server tab (the third button at the top of the License Manager window)
. Click on Log File. This will bring up the License Manager log file so you can review any errors
. Scroll to the bottom of the log to view the most recent errors. You may have to scroll up from the bottom to see complete errors
. If you receive a similar message to the one below (file paths may vary according to your system), the hostname of your license is not set correctly:

[source, log]
----
18:34:27 (lmgrd) "Rodrigo222": Not a valid server hostname, exiting.
18:34:27 (lmgrd) Valid license server system hosts are: "Rodrigo"
18:34:27 (lmgrd) Using license file
"Licenses//mocha_Pro_cross-platform_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic"
----

To fix this, edit the server host name in the server and client license by reactivating your license in the License Manager. This will affect these lines in the licenses:

[source, log]
----
SERVER Rodrigo 000000000000
VENDOR isl
----

You can also edit this manually in the license files themselves, but it is easier to just load License Manager and change the host name, then reactivate.

image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg["Hostname Activation",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg"]

Don't forget to click the Install Server License after you reactivate!
If you receive a similar message to the one below (file paths may vary according to your system), the Host ID of your computer and your license does not match. Please contact support to resolve the issue:

[source, log]
----
18:50:51 (isl) Wrong hostid on SERVER line for license file:
18:50:51 (isl) Licenses//mochapro_cross-platform_floating_license_v2.500.lic
18:50:51 (isl) SERVER line says 000000000000, hostid is ffffffffffff
18:50:51 (isl) Invalid hostid on SERVER line
----

In this case, you should contact support at https://borisfx.com/support/open-a-case/
For Linux and Mac OS X, you can reset the default directory location of your license server by running the command below in terminal:
rm ~/.flexlmrc


===== Restarting the license server to load a new configuration.
On Mac OS X you can stop and start the license server daemon by typing the 2 commands below inside the terminal and pressing return after each:

+sudo launchctl stop com.imagineersystems.lmgrd+

+sudo launchctl start com.imagineersystems.lmgrd+

On Linux you can stop and start the license server daemon by typing the 2 commands below inside the terminal and pressing return after each:

+sudo /etc/init.d/isllmgrd stop+

+sudo /etc/init.d/isllmgrd start+

For Windows (and Linux or Mac OS X) you can stop and start the system by doing the following:
. Load the License Manager (if you are on Windows, you must right-click and choose "Run as Administrator")
. Switch to the Server tab (the third button at the top of the License Manager window)
. Click the Stop button
. Click the Start button
If neither of these methods work, try restarting the server machine.


===== If your computer or server is not connected to the Internet
If you are not connect to the internet (or you are running an older version of our software that does not use activation codes) you will not be able to activate your software using an activation code: Connect to the Internet or contact support for a manual license if connecting to the Internet is impossible.
You will need to provide your Host ID and if you are installing on a server you will need to provide the exact server name. Both of these can be retrieved via the License Manager in the System Info section.

image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg["Hostname Activation",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531783954/documentation/mocha/images/5.0.0/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg"]

You will have to contact support to activate older, legacy versions of our software whether you have an Internet connection or not.
Please go to https://borisfx.com/support/open-a-case/ to send your server details.


===== Check to make sure your mocha software matches your activation code
Check your purchase order to make sure everything matches up version wise. It may be that you don't have the correct version of mocha installed from our download section. This is especially important for legacy software. The usual error for the wrong software or incorrect license for the software you are trying to run is "FLEXlm error: -5 No such feature exists."


===== Administrator or root installation
If you are not running as root on Linux or are not logged in as administrator of the machine, try running in admin or root mode and install again.


===== Installing Remotely
If you are attempting to install via Remote Desktop instead of directly on the machine itself and you are having trouble getting mocha or the FlexNet software to install, try installing directly on the machine. This applies to both server and client machines.


===== Check for conflicting licenses installed in your licensing folder
If you have more than one mocha license installed on the server or client machine check to make sure they are not expired licenses. While rare, sometimes these licenses can conflict with any current ones you have on your system.


===== The client does not connect or see the server host name
If your client machine does not connect to the server based on the server name, try replacing the server name with the IP address of the server instead in the license file. You can easily do this via the License Manager or via a text editor.


===== When in doubt, check the logs!
Check logs and their paths: Read the logs from mocha and from your server, they will tell you all about what is happening to your machine. You can match FlexNet errors to the list of FlexNet error codes in the "License Administration Guide" FlexNet documentation PDF here: http://www.globes.com/support/fnp_utilities_download.htm


===== Check to see if the server process is actually running
You can check to see if the server process is running by opening your License Manager and switching to the Server tab:

You can also check if ISL Services are running in Windows task manager:

And the isl process in Mac OS X:

===== Install mocha on the server to test the license
If you get client license issues, see if the license works on the server by installing the version of mocha you are trying to set up on the server and opening it up. If it runs in LE mode, the license is not properly installed. If it runs without asking you to activate, the license has been installed correctly on the server and you will need to troubleshoot your client machines.


===== Check your firewall settings
Check to make sure you are not restricted to using certain ports due to a firewall or other admin permissions. When in doubt, temporarily turn your firewalls off for the duration of the installation and then turn them back on when you are done.


===== Check your host name settings
If your client machine is not able to connect to the server you may have a networking issue. Try changing the server name in the client license to the IP address of the server instead, or check to see if your host has ".local" appended to the end of it.
You can do this by selecting IP address in the License Manager when you activate.
You can also do this in any text editor by opening up the client license and server license and manually editing the server name.


===== Sometimes the best solution is to start again
You might roll your eyes at this one, but try uninstalling, restarting your machine, and installing the software again from scratch. Make sure you follow installation directions off our website exactly. It sounds redundant, but sometimes it's a great way to troubleshoot what is going on inside your machine.
