== Stereo Interface

Some interface elements change when using Stereo footage. This section covers what new icons appear and how to interact with them.

=== Viewing in Stereo

In stereo mode you will see 3 buttons in the View Controls next to the clip view drop down on the left:

* Two buttons to show individual Left or Right views (*L* and *R*). These button names change according to the abbreviation you assign them in Project Settings.
* A 3D button to preview stereo views

You can preview stereo work at any time by turning on the *3D* button in the view controls.

Clicking and holding on the *3D* button will give you a range of stereo view options.
