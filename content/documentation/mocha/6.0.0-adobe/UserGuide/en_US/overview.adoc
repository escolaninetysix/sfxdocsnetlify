== Interface Overview

To quickly get familiar with Mocha before you dive into the rest of the manual, here is a breakdown of the interface and its controls.

NOTE: Interface Overview uses the Mocha Pro Interface. Versions of the Mocha Pro Plugin, Mocha HitFilm, Mocha for After Effects etc. may differ in presentation, but their tools perform the same function

=== Layouts [[layouts]]

Mocha layouts are modifiable, allowing you to hide or reveal many parts of the interface.

image:UserGuide/en_US/images/layouts_dropdown.jpg[width="60%"]

These layouts are clustered into 4 default types you can build from.

==== Essentials Layout

Mocha begins in the Essentials layout, which provides a simplified interface for basic tracking and roto.

image:UserGuide/en_US/images/main-overview-essentials.jpg[]

The basic toolbar provides a minimal set of tools without cluttering the interface.

The Essentials panel on the left side of the window combines everything you need for a basic track.

image:UserGuide/en_US/images/mochaae_essentials_panel.jpg[width="40%"]

The Panel contains the following features (from top to bottom):

*Track Motion Options*

The 5 motion types you can track in:

. Translation
. Scale
. Rotation
. Shear (sometimes known as Skew)
. Perspective

*Track Buttons*

For tracking backwards, forwards and to stop the track

*Link to Track*

To attach a spline layer to an existing track, or detach it from a track entirely.
See <<tracking_basics, Tracking Basics>> and <<roto_basics, Rotoscoping Basics>> for more information on the benefits of Link to Track.

*Surface*

These buttons control viewing and expanding the surface.
See <<tracking_basics, Tracking Basics>> for how to use the surface effectively.

* *Show surface (tracking data):* Reveals the blue surface that represents the tracking data.
* *Show grid:* Reveals a useful grid for lining up the surface or monitoring for drift in a track.
* *Align surface:* Expands the surface to fit the dimensions of the footage on the current frame.

==== Classic Layout

For Mocha veterans, the Classic layout is arranged like the original Mocha.

image:UserGuide/en_US/images/main-overview.jpg[]

Use this mode if you are familiar with Mocha and want access to all the parameters and tools.

==== Roto Layout

Like the Essentials layout, this layout is optimized specifically for roto sessions where only the most necessary panels and tools are shown.

==== Big Picture Layout

If you want to reduce all clutter entirely, the Big Picture layout is very useful for previewing shots without any elements getting in the way.

=== Saving Layouts

You can add or remove many parts of the Mocha interface, such as:

* Timeline controls
* Toolbars
* View controls
* Etc.

These can either be access by right clicking the area of the interface and choosing a GUI element to show or hide, or selecting from the `View` menu.

Any changes you make to a layout will not be saved unless you choose `View | Layout | Save Current Layout`.

For example if you like the Essentials layout, but would like the Advanced toolbar from the Classic layout:

. Choose "Essentials" from the layout drop-down
. Choose "Advanced Tools" from `View | Toolbars`
. Choose `View | Layout | Save Current Layout`

This will now save the Essentials layout with the new toolbar.

If you have made changes to a saved layout want to revert back to the saved version, just choose `View | Layout | Revert to saved`.

If you want to revert back to the original default layout, just choose `View | Layout | Revert to default`.


=== The Advanced Toolbar

image:UserGuide/en_US/images/MainToolbar.jpg[]

At the very top of the interface you have the tools that form the brunt of your time inside Mocha.

=== Cache Management

In Mocha v5 we introduced manual cache clearing to allow you to clear the Mocha cache at the project, render or global level.

You can access the Clear Cache option from the file menu under File -> Clear Cache...

image:UserGuide/en_US/images/clear_cache_dialog.jpg[width="60%"]

You can check the following options:

* *Project Cache:* Clear the cache for the currently loaded project
* *Rendered Clips:* Clear just the rendered clips for the project
* *Global Cache:* Clear everything in the entire Mocha cache.

Only clear the Global Cache if you are certain you don't want any of your existing project caches to remain.
