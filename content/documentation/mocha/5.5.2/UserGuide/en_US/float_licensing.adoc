== Installing Floating Licenses
This guide will walk you through the process of installing floating licenses. Installing node-locked licenses does not require the use of the license manager. See above.

=== Floating licenses - How it works
Because many work environments have a dynamic structure, Imagineer Systems offer floating licenses. This works by keeping the license file on a central server, which can then be used by multiple client machines.

For example, if your studio has 20 machines but you only need 5 people using our software at a time, you could get a 5-machine floating license, which can then be used on any 5 machines in your network. The software can then be installed on all 20 machines without needing individual licenses for each computer. When someone stops using the software on one machine, it then frees up that license spot for another machine on the network to use.

=== How do I install the floating license server?
Floating licenses can be complex to set up, and if you have no previous experience of configuring network services, the process can be quite daunting.

If you need any help, please link:/support/open-a-case[contact support]

However, you may find a solution to your problem faster if you scroll down to troubleshooting below.

NOTE: To configure a license server you must have Administrator (or root) privileges

=== How do I point to the server license using an Environment Variable?
If you want to point to a license file via environment variable, use ISL_LICENSE_FILE. It uses the usual flexlm syntax, e.g:

====
ISL_LICENSE_FILE=27000@server-name

ISL_LICENSE_FILE=/path/to/file.lic
====

You can also set up the ISL environment variable to read all  .lic files in a directory:
====
ISL_LICENSE_FILE=your/flexlm/directory
====

=== Installing Floating Licenses on Mac OS X

==== Mac OS X License Manager
. Download the OS X license manager from the link:/downloads/[download section]
. Open the License Manager DMG file and double-click the PKG file, then follow the installation prompts

The error log can be viewed by clicking Log File. This file is stored at: /Library/Logs/Imagineer Systems/lmgrd.log
. If your license server does not start automatically, restart the computer to automatically start it

====  Mac OS X Server License (Manual Install)

In case where you cannot install the license via an Activation code (normally where the server is not connected to the internet) you can manually install your license to Mac OS X:

. If you haven't already, install the License Manager as described above in the "Mac OS X License Manager" section.
. Copy your license file (e.g. mocha.lic) into /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses
. If your license server does not start automatically, restart the computer to automatically start it

==== Mac OS X Client Machine

Once you have the server license installed (see above), you can then install mocha on your client machine and activate.

. Click on *Activate* on the welcome screen in mocha
. Using the same activation code, paste this into the Activation field and click Activate
. The client license should now install to /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

==== Mac OS X Client Machine (Manual Install)

Once you have the server license installed, you can then install mocha on your client machine.

. If you received your license by e-mail skip to point 5
. Open the OS X License Manager
. Submit your Activation Code and click on Show Detail
. Click Install Client License and the file will save as client_license.lic
. Drag and drop the client license file into /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses on the client machine
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha


=== Installing Floating Licenses on Windows

==== Windows License Manager

NOTE: To configure a license server you must have Administrator privileges. Either login as Administrator or right-click the installer and choose "Run as Administrator".

. Download the Windows license manager from the link:/downloads/[download section]
. Double-click the MSI installation file and follow the prompts:
+

+
. The error log can be viewed by clicking Log File.
. If your license server does not start automatically, restart the computer to automatically start it

==== Windows Server License (Manual Install)

In cases where you cannot install the license via an Activation code (normally where the server is not connected to the internet) you can manually install your license to Windows:

. You should have already installed the Windows License Manager in the steps outlined above. This also installs the FlexLM server software into the default location.
. If you have requested to receive your floating license by e-mail, copy the license server file (e.g. mocha_Pro_cross-platform_floating_license_v3.000_server.lic), into the proper system licensing directory:
	* *Windows XP:* C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
	* *Windows Vista:* C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
	* *Windows 7/8/10:* C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
+
(Legacy versions of Imagineer Software may still use the directory C:\Program Files\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\)
+
. If your license server does not start automatically, restart the computer to automatically start it

==== Windows Client Machine

Once you have the server license installed (see above), you can then install mocha on your client machine and activate.

. Click on Activate on the welcome screen in mocha
. Using the same activation code, paste this into the Activation field and click Activate
. The client license should now install to:
	* *Windows XP:* C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
	* *Windows Vista:* C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
	* *Windows 7/8/10:* C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

==== Windows Client Machine (Manual Install)

Once you have the server license installed, you can then install mocha on your client machine.

. If you received your license by e-mail skip to point 5
. Open the Windows License Manager
. Submit your Activation Code and click on Show Detail
. Click generate client license and the file will save as client_license.lic
. The client license should now install to:
	* *Windows XP:* C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
	* *Windows Vista:* C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
	* *Windows 7/8/10:* C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

=== Installing Floating Licenses on Linux

==== Linux License Manager

If you have received an activation code you will need to use the license manager to activate your license. If you received your license file by e-mail, proceed to the "Linux License Server" section below.

. Download the Linux license manager from the link:/downloads/[download section]
. Make sure you have downloaded the correct version for your system. 64-bit versions of the software will not run on a 32-bit version of Linux.
. Double-click the RPM file to begin installation or install it from the terminal using sudo rpm -Uvh [PACKAGE_FILE].rpm, where [PACKAGE_FILE] is the name of the License Manager RPM file you have downloaded.

==== Linux License Server

To configure a license server as a service, you must have root privileges. We support license server installation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 32-bit systems, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 64 bit systems, and their equivalents.

. You should have already installed the Linux License Manager in the steps outlined above.
. After installing the License Manager, load it and use your activation code to activate
+
image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_linux_pre-activation.jpg["Linux License Manager",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_linux_pre-activation.jpg"]
+
. Press the Install Server License button in the License Manager to install the license to the server.
+
image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_linux_post-activation.jpg["Linux License Manager",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_linux_post-activation.jpg"]
+
. The manager will install the license file here: /etc/opt/isl/licences
. If you have requested to receive your license by e-mail, copy your License file (e.g. mocha.lic) into /etc/opt/isl/licences. Skip this step if you have used your activation code to install the server license instead.
. The server process should already be started automatically, but you can make sure by typing: /etc/init.d/isllmgrd start
. The server will start automatically at runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5. FLEXlm messages are logged to: /var/log/isllmgrd.log
. The init script accepts start, stop, restart and status commands, and also reread, which rereads the License file. The daemon is run by default as the nobody user. If this does not exist on your system, either create it or edit the script to use a different non-root user.

==== Linux Client Machine

Once you have the server license installed, you can then install mocha on your client machine and activate.

. Click on Activate on the welcome screen in mocha
. Using the same activation code, paste this into the Activation field and click Activate
. The client license should now install to: /etc/opt/isl/licences
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

==== Linux Client Machine (Manual Install)

Once you have the server license installed, you can then install mocha on your client machine.

. If you received your license by e-mail skip to point 5
. Open the Linux License Manager
. Submit your Activation Code and click on Show Detail
. Click generate client license and the file will save as client_license.lic
. The client license should be installed to: /etc/opt/isl/licences
. If the installation is successful, you will now be able to use mocha

=== Troubleshooting Floating Licenses

As with any software, problems may arise during the installation process. Please take a moment to read our troubleshooting section and check for common errors. You may also want to check out the link://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531790881/documentation/mocha/pdfs/fnp_LicAdmin.pdf[FlexNet License Administration Guide]

If you continue to have issues installing, please link:/support/open-a-case[contact support] and we will be happy to help you.


==== Verify your server license has been successfully installed
Check that your license actually exists on the Server

*Mac OS X:*  /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses/mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Windows XP:*  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Windows Vista:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Windows 7/8/10:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_cross_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic

*Linux:*  /etc/opt/isl/licences/mocha_Pro_cross-platform_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic


==== Verify your client license has been successfully installed
Check that your client license actually exists on the client machine

*Mac OS X:*  /Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems/FLEXlm/Licenses/mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Windows XP:*  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Windows Vista:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Windows 7/8/10:*  C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing\mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic

*Linux:*  /etc/opt/isl/licences/mocha_Pro_v2_client.lic


==== Verify you are using the latest version of the license server software.
Check the link:/downloads/[download section] to make sure your License Manager is up to date.
Sometimes there can be issues where a 64-bit version of the server software has been installed on a 32-bit version of Windows. If this is the case, uninstall the License Manager then go to the link:/downloads/[download section] of our website and download the correct bit version of the License Manager for your version of Windows. When in doubt, 32-bit should work.


==== Verify the SERVER port is not being used or blocked by another process
By default the license server runs in port 27000, but this can be blocked or used by other processes. You may see a TCP error in your server log file when it cannot read the port.

Check that ports 27000-27009 are open and not in use, or allocate a different port by editing the SERVER line in the license file:

[source, log]
----
SERVER servername 000000000000
----
to

[source, log]
----
SERVER servername 000000000000 12345
----

where 000000000000 is the host id and 12345 is a port chosen by the system administrator.


==== Verify there is not a firewall running between the server and the client computer
If your organization needs to run a firewall, you will need to open the ports of the license server manually. Normally the license server runs in port 27000, but if other FLEXnet license servers are present it may take a different port. To be safe, open ports 27000-27009. Also, the vendor daemon uses a port specified at run time. If a static port allocation is required, edit the license file and change:

[source, log]
----
VENDOR isl
----
to

[source, log]
----
VENDOR isl PORT=12345
----

where 12345 is a port chosen by the system administrator. Ideal port numbers are in the range of 49152 to 65535.


==== The client is receiving an error of -15 or -96

This means the server is not running correctly or there is a network problem between two computers. Please follow the steps below:

. Open the License Manager
. Switch to the Server tab (the third button at the top of the License Manager window)
. Click on Log File. This will bring up the License Manager log file so you can review any errors
. Scroll to the bottom of the log to view the most recent errors. You may have to scroll up from the bottom to see complete errors
. If you receive a similar message to the one below (file paths may vary according to your system), the hostname of your license is not set correctly:

[source, log]
----
18:34:27 (lmgrd) "Rodrigo222": Not a valid server hostname, exiting.
18:34:27 (lmgrd) Valid license server system hosts are: "Rodrigo"
18:34:27 (lmgrd) Using license file
"Licenses//mocha_Pro_cross-platform_floating_license_v2.500_server.lic"
----

To fix this, edit the server host name in the server and client license by reactivating your license in the License Manager. This will affect these lines in the licenses:

[source, log]
----
SERVER Rodrigo 000000000000
VENDOR isl
----

You can also edit this manually in the license files themselves, but it is easier to just load License Manager and change the host name, then reactivate.

image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg["Hostname Activation",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg"]

Don't forget to click the Install Server License after you reactivate!
If you receive a similar message to the one below (file paths may vary according to your system), the Host ID of your computer and your license does not match. Please link:/support/open-a-case[contact support] to resolve the issue:

[source, log]
----
18:50:51 (isl) Wrong hostid on SERVER line for license file:
18:50:51 (isl) Licenses//mochapro_cross-platform_floating_license_v2.500.lic
18:50:51 (isl) SERVER line says 000000000000, hostid is ffffffffffff
18:50:51 (isl) Invalid hostid on SERVER line
----

In this case, you should link:/support/open-a-case[contact support]
For Linux and Mac OS X, you can reset the default directory location of your license server by running the command below in terminal:
rm ~/.flexlmrc

==== Verify how many licenses are in use and where
To check who is using the current server licenses, look for output similar to the following:

[source, log]
----
12:08:24 (isl) OUT: "mpp-ofx5" arthur@camlelot
12:08:24 (isl) OUT: "mpp-ofx.soho" arthur@camelot
12:08:24 (isl) OUT: "mpp-ofx.track" arthur@camlelot
12:08:24 (isl) OUT: "mpp-ofx.image" arthur@camlelot
12:08:24 (isl) OUT: "mpp-ofx.remove" arthur@camlelot
12:08:24 (isl) OUT: "mpp-ofx.adjusttrack" arthur@camlelot
----

The basic format above is:

[source, log]
----
[TIMESTAMP] (isl) [LICENSE STATE] [LICENSE FEATURE] [USER]@[HOSTNAME]
----

This helps you determine who currently has a license checked in or out.

If you are seeing errors such as the one below, this means all available licenses are already checked out:

[source, log]
----
10:35:18 (isl) DENIED: "mpp-ofx.track" arthur@camelot  (Licensed number of users already reached. (-4,342))
----



==== Restarting the license server to load a new configuration.
On Mac OS X you can stop and start the license server daemon by typing the 2 commands below inside the terminal and pressing return after each:

+sudo launchctl stop com.imagineersystems.lmgrd+

+sudo launchctl start com.imagineersystems.lmgrd+

On Linux you can stop and start the license server daemon by typing the 2 commands below inside the terminal and pressing return after each:

+sudo /etc/init.d/isllmgrd stop+

+sudo /etc/init.d/isllmgrd start+

For Windows (and Linux or Mac OS X) you can stop and start the system by doing the following:
. Load the License Manager (if you are on Windows, you must right-click and choose "Run as Administrator")
. Switch to the Server tab (the third button at the top of the License Manager window)
. Click the Stop button
. Click the Start button
If neither of these methods work, try restarting the server machine.


==== If your computer or server is not connected to the Internet
If you are not connect to the internet (or you are running an older version of our software that does not use activation codes) you will not be able to activate your software using an activation code: Connect to the Internet or link:/support/open-a-case[contact support] for a manual license if connecting to the Internet is impossible.
You will need to provide your Host ID and if you are installing on a server you will need to provide the exact server name. Both of these can be retrieved via the License Manager in the System Info section.

image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg["Hostname Activation",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_hostnameactivation001.jpg"]

You will have to link:/support/open-a-case[contact support] to activate older, legacy versions of our software whether you have an Internet connection or not.
Please link:/support/open-a-case[contact support] to send your server details.


==== Check to make sure your mocha software matches your activation code
Check your purchase order to make sure everything matches up version wise. It may be that you don't have the correct version of mocha installed from our download section. This is especially important for legacy software. The usual error for the wrong software or incorrect license for the software you are trying to run is "FLEXlm error: -5 No such feature exists."


==== Administrator or root installation
If you are not running as root on Linux or are not logged in as administrator of the machine, try running in admin or root mode and install again.


==== Installing Remotely
If you are attempting to install via Remote Desktop instead of directly on the machine itself and you are having trouble getting mocha or the FlexNet software to install, try installing directly on the machine. This applies to both server and client machines.


==== Check for conflicting licenses installed in your licensing folder
If you have more than one mocha license installed on the server or client machine check to make sure they are not expired licenses. While rare, sometimes these licenses can conflict with any current ones you have on your system.


==== The client does not connect or see the server host name
If your client machine does not connect to the server based on the server name, try replacing the server name with the IP address of the server instead in the license file. You can easily do this via the License Manager or via a text editor.


==== When in doubt, check the logs!
Check logs and their paths: Read the logs from mocha and from your server, they will tell you all about what is happening to your machine. You can match FlexNet errors to the list of FlexNet error codes in the link://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531790881/documentation/mocha/pdfs/fnp_LicAdmin.pdf[FlexNet License Administration Guide].


==== Check to see if the server process is actually running
You can check to see if the server process is running by opening your License Manager and switching to the Server tab:

image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_server_process001.jpg["Server Process",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_server_process001.jpg"]

You can also check if ISL Services are running in Windows task manager:

image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_win7_isl_service001.jpg["Server process",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_win7_isl_service001.jpg"]

And the isl process in Mac OS X:

image:://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_islprocess001.jpg["Server process",link="//borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/lm_osx_islprocess001.jpg"]


==== Install mocha on the server to test the license
If you get client license issues, see if the license works on the server by installing the version of mocha you are trying to set up on the server and opening it up. If it runs in LE mode, the license is not properly installed. If it runs without asking you to activate, the license has been installed correctly on the server and you will need to troubleshoot your client machines.


==== Check your firewall settings
Check to make sure you are not restricted to using certain ports due to a firewall or other admin permissions. When in doubt, temporarily turn your firewalls off for the duration of the installation and then turn them back on when you are done.


==== Check your host name settings
If your client machine is not able to connect to the server you may have a networking issue. Try changing the server name in the client license to the IP address of the server instead, or check to see if your host has ".local" appended to the end of it.
You can do this by selecting IP address in the License Manager when you activate.
You can also do this in any text editor by opening up the client license and server license and manually editing the server name.


==== Sometimes the best solution is to start again
You might roll your eyes at this one, but try uninstalling, restarting your machine, and installing the software again from scratch. Make sure you follow installation directions off our website exactly. It sounds redundant, but sometimes it's a great way to troubleshoot what is going on inside your machine.

== Installing Render Licenses

This section will discuss the installation of floating render licenses and how they differ from standard interactive floating licensed.

=== Render Floating Licenses vs Interactive Floating Licenses

A render license is a specific kind of floating license that only allows rendering of mocha project output, be it inside a plugin or in the standalone application.

When you are using a floating license, it is broken into two parts: The interactive portion and the rendering portion.

For plugins, this is separated like so:

. If you open the mocha GUI in the mocha Pro Plugin (and a license is available) you are entering the interactive portion.
. If you are back in the host and not using interactive elements such as layer choosing or opening the GUI, you are using the rendering portion of the license.

For the standalone, this is separated like so:

. If you open the mocha Pro standalone application (and a license is available) you are entering the interactive portion.
. If you have the mocha Pro standalone application closed and are using the mocharender.py render script, you are utilizing the rendering portion. (See the Python guide for more details on rendering with mocharender.py)

If the interactive license is in use elsewhere or missing, the mocha GUI will become unlicensed and attempting further work may encrypt your project if you choose to save.
If you have no interactive floating licenses available to render with, additional render licenses can be helpful to let you free up interactive licenses elsewhere.

==== Workflow for Render Licenses: Example 1

To help illustrate the Render License workflow, let's look at the following situation:

* 5 floating licenses (interactive)
* 10 render licenses (render only)
* There is only 1 user

The license server is operating with both sets of licenses.

* If only one person is using mocha on the network, there are 4 interactive and 10 render licenses still available to use.
* If only that one person was using mocha on the network, they would have 15 render machines available for use including the one they were working with.
* If another person started working and all machines were in use for rendering, their version of mocha would be unlicensed, as there would be no available seats.

==== Workflow for Render Licenses: Example 2

To help illustrate the Render License workflow, let's look at another situation:

* 5 floating licenses (interactive)
* 10 render licenses (render only)
* There are 5 users

The license server is operating with both sets of licenses.

* There are 5 people working in mocha.
* If another user tries to work on a 6th machine, they will open mocha unlicensed, because all interactive licenses are in use.
* They open an existing project with mocha in it (or render from the command line), they will be able to render, because all render licenses are available.

Now, say one person wants to send off a render to the network:

* If 5 people are using mocha on the network already, there would be 11 render machines available for use including the one the user was presently working with.
* If another person stopped working in mocha, the interactive license would be released, and a new machine would then be free to either use for work (interactive) or render (non-interactive) by another user.


=== Installing Render Floating Licenses

The installation of a render license is exactly the same as that of a standard interactive floating license. See the 'Installing Floating Licenses' for a complete guide.

=== File Management for Rendering on a Network

If you are planning to render either via the mocha render scripts, an Adobe watch folder or a render farm (for example in Nuke), there are some file workflows you need to adopt.

You will need to make sure the necessary source footage is available for all machines. This includes anything you have imported into the mocha GUI such as clean plates, insert clips and other imported files.

These files need to be managed by any of the following methods:

* Placed in the same file structure on all machines
* Relinked manually with an interactive license on all machines
* Pointing to the same shared directory.

Failing to set this up may result in incorrect renders.

IMPORTANT: If you are using the plugin, you may have imported footage into the mocha GUI separate from the host source footage. Make sure any imported footage is also available.
