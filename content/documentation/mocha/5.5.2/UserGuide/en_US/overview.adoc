To quickly get familiar with mocha before you dive into the rest of the manual, here is a breakdown of the interface and its controls.

NOTE: Interface Overview uses the mocha Pro Interface. Versions of the mocha Pro Plugin, mocha HitFilm, mocha for After Effects etc. may differ in presentation, but their tools perform the same function

=== The Main Toolbar

image://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/MainToolbar.jpg[]

At the very top of the interface you have the tools that form the brunt of your time inside mocha.

=== Cache Management

In mocha v5 we introduced manual cache clearing to allow you to clear the mocha cache at the project, render or global level.

You can access the Clear Cache option from the file menu under File -> Clear Cache...

image://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531784130/documentation/mocha/images/5.5.2/5.0.0_mochapro_clear_cache_dialog.jpg[]

You can check the following options:

* *Project Cache:* Clear the cache for the currently loaded project
* *Rendered Clips:* Clear just the rendered clips for the project
* *Global Cache:* Clear everything in the entire mocha cache.

Only clear the Global Cache if you are certain you don't want any of your existing project caches to remain.
