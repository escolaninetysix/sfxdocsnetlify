== OpenColorIO (OCIO)

Mocha Pro has OCIO functionality in both the standalone version and the plugin.

Depending on the color profile you are working with, a number of display options are available via the Viewer Preferences:

The controls are listed at the bottom of the Viewer Preferences dialog:

The plugin version of Mocha Pro will automatically try to use the current host colorspace.

=== Loading OpenColorIO configurations into Mocha Pro

The default config field is read-only, and only shows the current OCIO config file if there is one.

In order to set a config, you need to define the environment variable OCIO and point it to the config file path, for example:

[source, text]
----
export OCIO=$HOME/OCIO/nuke-default/config.ocio
----

Then run Mocha (or your plugin host) from the terminal after defining this variable.

You could also set the OCIO environment variable system-wide using an appropriate OS-specific method
(e.g. the Environment Variables dialog in Windows).

If there is no config set, you should see a blank Config field and just “raw” or “*default” in the dropdowns.

If you set a valid config path, you should see the complete list of supported colorspaces.

Once set, the OCIO config will be saved with the project.
