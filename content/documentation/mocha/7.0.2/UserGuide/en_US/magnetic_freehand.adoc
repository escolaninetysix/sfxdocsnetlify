== Rotoscoping with Magnetic and Freehand Tools [[magnetic_freehand]]

The magnetic and freehand tools provide an easy way to quickly roto an object.

=== The Magnetic Tool

The Magnetic Tool draws a pixel line that snaps to the nearest edge to where the cursor lies, tracing the shortest path from any previous click.

To use the Magnetic Tool:

. Select the tool from the toolbar.
. Click once near the edge you want to start with
. Move your cursor along the edge you want to follow
. Click once any time you want to anchor the currently drawn path along the route
. If there is a tricky section of the edge that the magnetic tool doesn't want to line up to,
you can *press and hold the mouse/pen down* and the tool will switch to Freehand mode.

Similarly, if you go off the edge of the frame, the magnetic tool will also switch to Freehand mode,
so you can freely continue the shape.

=== The Freehand Tool

The Freehand pen tool is exactly like the Magnetic tool, minus the magnetic properties.

This gives you the freedom to quickly draw any line.

You can access the Freehand tool in the same tool drop down as the Magnetic tool, but also any time you
*press and hold the mouse/pen down* in the Magnetic tool, or go off the image frame.


=== Finalising a Drawn Line

One you have completed a drawn line, you can either click back on the original point, or right-click.

This will generate an X-Spline that follows the originally drawn line.

=== Adjusting Detail

X-Splines generated by the Magnetic and Freehand tools have a fairly high point count to match the subtle changes in the line.

If you want to increase or reduce this detail:

. Finish drawing the line and right-click. This will automatically switch your cursor to the selection tool.
. With the completed layer selected, choose the Magnetic or Freehand tool again.
. The Detail parameter will enable in the Layer Properties panel
. Adjust detail to increase or reduce the number of spline points

IMPORTANT: Adjusting the detail of a magnetic or freehand line will move the points back to their original positions to re-fit the line.

WARNING: Animation or extended editing of a magnetic or freehand layer spline may permanently convert it to a regular spline.

=== Edge Snapping [[Edge_Snap]]

You can snap the control points of any spline to edges of an object by using the Edge Snapping tool.
By default, this is the 'Alt+S' keys.

To snap to an edge:

. Select the points you want to move
. Press the 'Alt+S' key once to snap

Alternatively hold the 'S' key and drag the points.

The points should then move to snap to the nearest detectable edge.

Keep in mind this will naturally try to find the most visible edge, so in some cases snap may not find the edge you want.
In these cases it may need to be adjusted manually.
