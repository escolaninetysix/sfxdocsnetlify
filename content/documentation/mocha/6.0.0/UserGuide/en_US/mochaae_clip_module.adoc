== The Clip Module

=== General Clip View

The Clip module previews your clips in Mocha. It provide basic clip property information.

=== Managing clips

You cannot manage clips in this version of Mocha. To import additional clips, manage clip streams or handle stereo, you need *Mocha Pro*.

=== Crop Mask

You can mask down the clip to only allow Mocha to handle parts of the footage.
This is useful when you only need to track some area of the clip, or need to crop out letter boxing.

You can either adjust the Clip mask by moving the yellow dotted line on screen, or manually entering values into the Crop Mask parameters.

=== Timeline numbering

Here you can set whether you want the timeline display to be in frames or timecode.
