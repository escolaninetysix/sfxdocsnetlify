== Merging and Importing Projects

=== Merging Projects [Mocha Pro]

If you are working on a large roto project you will sometimes need to have more than one person working on the same shot.

When it comes time to export out mattes or do final tweaks you can use the *Merge Project* option to combine any files that have been used on the same piece of footage.

Simply select the *Merge Project* option from the File menu, and select a project you wish to merge. You can only merge projects that are the same dimensions, aspect ratio and frame length as the shot you are merging into.

*NOTE: You cannot merge projects from versions of Mocha earlier than 3.0.0.*


=== Importing Silhouette SFX projects

Mocha can also import Silhouette .sfx project files. To import a project:

. Open or create a project with matching footage and same dimensions as the Silhouette file. This is important. Your Silhouette project file will need to match the frame rate, dimensions and length of the Mocha project to correctly import.
. Go to File -> Import -> SFX Project Shapes...
. Choose a Silhouette sfx project file. If you are in OS X, you may need to navigate inside the sfx package to find the actual project file.
. Click Open

The Silhouette project will then convert any Bezier and X-splines to native Mocha splines and appear in the project.
If there are any B-Spline layers in the project, these will not be imported as they are currently not supported.
