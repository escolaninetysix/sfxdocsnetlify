== Painting Splines with the Area Brush Tool [[area_brush_tool]]

The Area Brush produces X-Splines based on paint strokes in the viewer canvas.

You can also paint on an existing layer with the "Add" paint brush.

Paint strokes that cross over an existing layer spline will intersect with that spline, or subtract from it if you are using the `alt` modifier key.

NOTE: Area Brush is currently a single-frame paint effect. It is not keyframeable.

=== Painting new layers with Area Brush

You can select the Area brush from the toolbar:

Selecting the area brush reveals the Area brush settings further down the toolbar:

You can now paint on the canvas and a red paint area will appear.

Once done, you can turn off Quick Mask if it is on or just release the mouse button and a spline will be generated.

=== Adjusting the size of the brush

You can adjust the brush size using either:

* The radius keys (by default this is '[' and ']').
* Holding down the CMD/Ctrl key and dragging the cursor
* Editing the radius field directly in the Area Brush toolbar

For finer control, the brush size will also change according to the set pressure sensitivity from a drawing tablet.

You can turn off pressure sensitivity from Preferences.

=== Quick Mask
By default, Quick Mask is turned on.

Quick Mask stops the Area Brush tool from generating a spline as soon as you release the mouse or lift the tablet pen
Once you have painted what you need, you can turn Quick Mask off by pressing the button and the spline will be generated.

=== Fill Gaps

If you want to quickly fill smaller gaps, you can adjust the "Fill Gaps" field.

The number in the field is a pixel diameter. Any gap in a closed painted area that is smaller than the number in the field will be filled.
For example:

* A Fill Gap diameter of 1 will only fill tiny gaps.
* A Fill Gap diameter of 1000 in a 1920x1080 image will close very large gaps.

A large fill gap setting is useful for quickly circling an object with paint to make a filled spline.


=== Add Area Brush to Layer

The Add Area Brush will add new paint-generated splines to the selected layer.

The tool is under the main Area Brush icon. Just press and hold the toolbar icon to select the brush from the list:

Then you can paint on the existing spline:

Once done, you can turn off Quick Mask if it is on or just release the mouse button and the resulting spline intersect with the existing layer splines:

=== Erase

In both Quick Mask mode and normal painting mode, you can hold down the `alt/option` key to switch to erase mode.

In Quick Mask mode, this will erase existing paint:

If Quick Mask mode is off, this will erase the existing spline if you are using the Add Area Brush tool. Just paint as normal holding down the modifier key:

When you release, the erase will eat into the existing spline:
