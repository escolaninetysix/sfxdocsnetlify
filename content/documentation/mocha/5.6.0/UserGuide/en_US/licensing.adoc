== Installing Node-Locked Licenses


=== Node-locked Installation

. Make sure you have downloaded the correct version of Mocha for your operating system. The licensing system for this version is different from v4 and earlier.
. Make that your version of Mocha is the product you have purchased (You will not be able to use a Mocha Pro AVX Plugin activation code for Mocha Pro standalone unless you have a multi-host license for example.).
. You will need to install the Mocha package:
	* Apple OS: Double-click the dmg package and drag the application to your application folder
	* Windows: Double-click the exe package and follow the instructions
	* Linux: Double-click the installation rpm file and follow the on screen instructions. (64-bit versions of the software will not run on a 32-bit version of Linux).

After that, the rest is the same as the process above for Mocha standalone. See "Standard Node-Locked License Activation for Mocha Pro Standalone" for more details.

We recommend restarting the host if you see any issues with licensing.


==== Node-Locked License Troubleshooting

. It is important that your Mocha software matches your activation code, so check your purchase order to make sure everything matches up version wise. It may be that you don’t have the correct version of Mocha installed from our download section. This is especially important for legacy software before V5, where a different licensing method is used.
. If you are attempting to install via a terminal instead of directly on the machine itself and you are having trouble getting Mocha to install, try installing directly on the machine.
. Check to make sure you are not restricted to using certain ports due to a firewall or other admin permissions. When in doubt, temporarily turn your firewalls off for the duration of the installation and then turn them back on when you are done.
. Troubleshoot your machine; try uninstalling all your Mocha software, restarting your machine, and installing the software again from scratch, and make sure you follow installation directions off our website exactly. It sounds redundant, but sometimes it’s a great way to figure out what is going on inside your machine.
. If all else fails, our support team is happy to help you figure this out. Please contact support!
