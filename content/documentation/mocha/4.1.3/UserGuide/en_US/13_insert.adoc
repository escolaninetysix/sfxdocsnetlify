== Mocha Pro - The Insert Module


=== Overview

NOTE: This section only relates to *mocha Pro*. This feature is not available in *mocha Plus, mocha HitFilm or mocha AE*.  For a full comparison of features, please refer to the comparison chart online.

The Insert module is where you choose the image you would like to insert into your tracked layer. You can import a still frame or a moving sequence. Once imported, the Insert module provides a comprehensive range of tools for matching this new image to the original background layer. The skill here, naturally, is to make the newly imported image look like it was in the original shot all along.

==== Input

This is where you choose the Input Clip or background layer and the Insert Clip or foreground layer, and optionally a separate input clip with an alpha channel for compositing.

*Input Clip*
 
By default *mocha Pro* selects the last clip that was tracked as the input. If you want to change the input, just select a different clip from the pulldown menu.


*Insert Clip*
 
By default *_mocha Pro_* selects None as the foreground input, expecting you to make a choice of your own. To choose an insert select the Import button and use the file browser to locate a still frame or a file sequence that you would like to appear over the tracked background clip.


*Alpha Input Clip*
 
If you have created a clip which contains an alpha channel for the input clip, for instance using chromakey software or rotoscoped mattes, you can import them here using the Import button. Alternatively select an internally generated clip. To switch on the alpha channel when rendering a layer, switch on the Use Input Clip Alpha feature in the Comp section, optionally inverting it by clicking on Invert and adjusting the scaling of the alpha values by adjusting the Opacity value.


*Alpha Insert Clip*
 
If you have created a clip which contains an alpha channel for rendering the insert, you can import it here. You will also need to switch on "Use Insert Clip Alpha" in the Comp section to use this feature, optionally inverting the alpha values by clicking on Invert, and adjusting the scaling of the alpha values by adjusting the Opacity value. The clip must inherit properties of the insert clip, so specify the insert clip as the "Inherit attributes" of clip when importing it.


==== Output

Here you can select the name of the clip to be output. Once a clip has been rendered it is automatically named Composite_&lt;clipname&gt;.

To choose a different name for the output clip select the New... button and choose a new name.

The remainder of the controls in the Insert module dictate both how much of the insert is displayed and how it is displayed during the course of the shot.


==== Export Offset Tracking Data

Export the offset track. The offsets are keyframed settings of the position of the insert.
 

==== ROI

The region of interest (ROI) can move anywhere on the insert image, including outside it. It is the area of the insert that you would like to be displayed in the tracked layer. As you adjust the ROI, the insert is scaled to fit the surface. There is also a Reset button to reset the ROI to the corners of the insert image. By default, the aspect ratio is locked. Uncheck Lock Aspect Ratio to allow arbitrary ROI changes.

To adjust the ROI aspect ratio to match that of the background image given its current position and shape in the background image, click on Fit ROI to Surface. Conversely, the Fit Surface to ROI button moves the surface position to match the aspect ratio of the insert image, given its ROI settings. These controls will work best if you are in a frame where the insert is as front-on as possible. For them to work correctly, the pixel aspect ratio of both the input clip and insert clip must be correct. A common issue is that if the resolution of either clip was not recognized when the clip was imported, it is assigned the PAL camera type. This often does not give the correct pixel aspect ratio. To check this, switch to the Camera tool and select each clip in turn, checking the appearance on the screen to make sure that each clip appears correct on the screen. If not, change the Film Type. If you know that the pixel aspect ratio of the clip is one (square pixels) select Custom as the Film Type and set the pixel aspect ratio to one.

The number fields are positioned in the menu to relate to the edge of the ROI that they adjust. So, to reduce the height of the insert ROI at the top of the frame, decrease the value in the top ROI number field by dragging or highlighting the current value and typing in a new value. Similarly, to reduce the height of the insert ROI at the bottom of the frame, increase the value in the bottom number field by dragging or highlighting the current value and typing in a new value. The same applies for the left and right edges of the frame with the left and right number fields.


==== Insert

*Opacity*
 
This parameter controls the opacity of the foreground image insert. It is a multiplier of the alpha of the insert, applied before the composite.


*Gain*
 
This is where you color correct the insert once it has been added to the tracked layer.

*All*
 
Increasing this value (by dragging or highlighting the current value and typing in a new value) will add brightness to the overall image by adjusting all the color channels. Decreasing this value would reduce the brightness or darken the insert.


*Blur*
 
*mocha Pro* can use the motion tracked data it has gathered to compute the correct amount of motion blur that should be applied to an insert in a tracked layer. If the tracked layer appears to have fast movement at any stage during the duration of the clip, applying motion blur will add to the realism, further matching the newly inserted foreground layer to the original background layer.


*Focus Blur*
 
Select this button if you want to apply focus blur to your insert. Having rendered the clip, if you feel that there is not enough or too much blur you can adjust the slider by dragging or highlighting the current value and typing in a new value to increase or decrease the amount of blur.


*Motion Blur*
 
Select this button if you want to apply motion blur to your insert. Having rendered the clip, if you feel that there is not enough or too much blur you can adjust the slider by dragging or highlighting the current value and typing in a new value to increase or decrease the amount of blur.


*Antialiasing*
 
Select this button if you want to apply antialiasing to your insert. Having rendered the clip, if you feel that there is not enough or too much antialiasing you can adjust the slider by dragging or highlighting the current value and typing in a new value to increase or decrease the amount. This is mainly used to apply a subtle pixel blur to inserts that are being significantly scaled down or to ensure that text files appear to have clean edges around the letters.


*Enhance Edges*
 
The inserted image can appear slightly smoother than the background image. This option enhances the edges in the insert to compensate for this. The level of edge enhancement can be adjusted with the provided parameter.


*Warp*
 
Warp uses a warp mesh to distort your insert. If you turn on "Show Mesh" in the warp tools you can use the dropdown to set the level of detail in the mesh and then warp the grid points in the viewer to adjust your insert, as well as the outer yellow lines to bulge or pinch the edges.

This is especially useful if you have to insert something that does not look completely planar, like a t-shirt logo.


==== Comp

The composite tools are for applying and working with alpha channels or mattes from different sources.

*Use Insert Clip Alpha*
 
If the insert that you are importing was created with an embedded alpha channel, it can be applied by selecting the Use Insert Clip Alpha button. The embedded alpha channel can also be inverted by selecting the Invert button beneath the Use Insert Clip Alpha button, and scaled up or down by adjusting the value in the Opacity field by dragging or highlighting the current value and typing in a new value. You can erode the alpha channel when rendering using the Erode Alpha parameter. You can also specify an alternative clip to use for the alpha channel using the Alpha Insert Clip selector in the Advanced Input section.


*Use Matte*
 
If you want to mask off an area of your insert, clicking on Use Matte will cause the rendered insert to only change the pixels within the matte for the rendered layer. If you then select the Invert button, only the portion of the insert inside the matte will be displayed. Remember that you can mask out areas of the matte using other layers built on top of the rendered layer.


*Use Input Alpha*
 
If you specified or imported a clip with an alpha channel in the Alpha Input Clip selector of Advanced Input, the controls here will apply to that clip.   Selecting the Invert button inverts the alpha channel.


*Erode Alpha*
 
Change this value from its default zero value to erode the alpha channel of the insert by the given number of pixels.


*Restrict Filters using Alpha*
 
Switch this on to restrict the action of the color filters (described below) to the area of pixels which are affected by the final composite, that is the pixels in the insert which have non-zero alpha before the composite, taking into account the alpha channel settings above.


==== Offset

This section controls a level of corner pin control on top of the adjusted track. This feature is particularly useful for curved surfaces. It allows the corners of the surface to be used in the same way as the warp control points (described below) – by aligning the newly imported insert with a region of the tracked image independently of the blue surface contour, which follows the adjusted track. 

The offset region is drawn in yellow underneath the existing blue surface. You can use the new points either by dragging the sliders to increase or decrease the value of the coordinates, or by highlighting the numeric field and typing in a new value. In addition to this you can hold down the Alt and Control keys on the keyboard (Alt+Cmd on a Mac) whilst dragging a surface point or line to achieve the same result. The new points created are offset in a controlled way from the adjusted track. 

Hold down Alt, Control and Shift (Alt+Shift+Cmd on a Mac) to gear the changes down 10 times. There is finally a Reset button to return the offset parameters to their defaults.

When using the rotate tool to rotate the offset surface, the pixel aspect ratio of the insert clip will be used to create the correct effect. If it is not correct the offset surface will appear to squeeze or stretch as it is rotated. See the *_ROI_* section to see how to fix this problem.


==== Edge

If you want to add a soft edge around the edges of the insert, use the Edge controls. There are separate controls for the left, right, top and bottom edge widths, which are between 0 and 1, where the value 0 indicates no edge and 1 means that the edge covers the whole of the insert.
			
image://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1531777181/documentation/mocha/images/4.1.3/edge.jpg[]				
			

If you switch on Lock, all four edges are locked to the same edge width. H Lock and V Lock apply lock separately to the left/right and the top/bottom edges respectively.

=== Insert in Stereo

All inserts are warped in stereo if you have tracked both views. 
You can render the insert for both views by selecting *Operate on All Views* button next to the Render buttons on the timeline.
