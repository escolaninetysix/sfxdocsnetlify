=== Keyboard Shortcut customization

You can now customize keyboard shortcuts for almost every tool, action and menu item in mocha.

.You can access the keyboard shortcut customization dialog in two ways:
. Directly, via File | Keyboard | Customize...
. By going to mocha Preferences and clicking the Key Shortcuts tab.

You can create a new profile by duplicating a default profile, then customize the keys.  These profiles are then available from the Keyboard menu:

.Keyboard customization is very simple:
. Duplicate one of the default profiles and rename it
. Select a category and choose an action you want to change or add a key sequence to
. Click in the "Shortcut" column
. Enter your key sequence
. Click anywhere outside of the entry cell to complete
. Click "Default" if you want to revert your change back to the default shortcut
