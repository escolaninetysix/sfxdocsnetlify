**Mocha Pro's**X-spline and Bezier creation tools are purposely designed to quicklycreate detailed roto shapes. When linked to **Mochaâ€™s** planar tracking, roto shapes inherit motion and perspective, dramatically reducing manual keyframe work. Advanced tools for shape editing include per-point edge feathering, join layers tool, transform tool, group layers and more making Mocha the ideal system for rotoscoping.

**Roto Features:** Unlimited X-Spline &amp; Bezier Layers Stereoscopic 3D Roto Workflow Edge Feathering: Variable per-point spline edge softness Layer Organization Tools: Color Spline, color fill, group and merge layers Transform Tool: Nudge, scale, rotate and distort multi-selected layers or spline points Join Layers Tool: Parent spline points from 2 different layers ber Key: A master keyframe function for added keyframe flexibility Stereo 3D Roto workflow: Export: Copy/Paste or export to common roto &amp; mask file formats. Motion Blur: Render external mattes with motion blur
