[Silhouette Paint](https://borisfx.com/products/silhouette-paint/) handles common invisible VFX tasks like object and logo removes with ease. Simple patching doesn’t work when lighting or colors change during the shot.

Learn about Silhouette Paint’s different techniques to create seamless removals on one frame or across your footage. Find out which core digital paint tools will work best and how to paint on one frame and expand those strokes automatically to the rest of your shot.

Silhouette Paint is available as a plugin for Adobe and OFX or as part of the standalone Silhouette application.
