In this video tutorial, Imagineer Systems Product Manager Martin Brennand
shows how to use Mocha's powerful planar tracking to solve a difficult cell
phone screen track that moves offscreen and out of focus. He then use Boris
Continuum Complete 9 Corner Pin plug-in to import the track data into both
Avid Media Composer and Adobe Premiere Pro CC. Both Mocha AE v3 and Mocha Pro
v3 support BCC tracking data imports. For more information on Mocha:
