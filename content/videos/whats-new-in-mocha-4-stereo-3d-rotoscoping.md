A quick look at what is new inside **Mocha** version 4.

A major change to **Mocha Pro's** workflow is being able to choose between
working on mono or stereoscopic projects. You can now import stereo 3D views
and track, roto and render, then export back to stereo.

**Mocha Pro 4** has been updated to support native stereo 3D. This new workflow uses planar tracking analysis on “both views” to reduce manual offsets and tedious keyframe work on stereo 3D roto, tracking and object removal.

Stereo roto and tracking exports for NUKE and Adobe After Effects. Stereo 3D
Camera FBX exports.
