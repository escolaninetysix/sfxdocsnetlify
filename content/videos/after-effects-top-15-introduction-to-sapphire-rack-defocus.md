Join John Dickinson of Motionworks.net as he takes an introductory look at the
Sapphire RackDefocus effect in Adobe After Effects. RackDefocus is a blur
effect that simulates actual defocused camera lens by creating “circles of
confusion” on the bright spots of your footage. John will guide you through
the parameters of RackDefocus to create a beautiful motion graphics
background. Be sure to visit genarts.com to learn more about Sapphire plug-ins
for Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic
Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke by The Foundry, and many more!
