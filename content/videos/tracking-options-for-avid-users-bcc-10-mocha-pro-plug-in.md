Colorist &amp; finishing artist Dan Harvey shows Boris Continuum Complete +
Avid Media Composer users the main differences between three different types
of motion tracking available through Boris FX and Imagineer Systems.

Part I. Covers the point motion tracker built into BCC for simple motion
tracking tasks.

Part II. Covers the integrated Mocha/BCC Pixel Chooser (found in BCC 10) which
can be used for planar tracking and rotoscoping tasks including effects
isolation and screen replacement.

Part III. Covers the new Mocha Pro 5 plug-in for Avid, which is best for
advanced compositing and finishing tasks. The plug-in harnesses the full power
of Mocha Pro directly in your timeline, including tracking, roto and the
additions of insert module, the stabilize module, Lens module and the remove
tool.
