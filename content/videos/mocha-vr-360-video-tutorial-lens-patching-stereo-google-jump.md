Find out how you can use Adobe After Effects and [Mocha VR](/products/mocha-pro/ "Editing with Mocha VR from Boris FX") to paint out rigs and shadows on stereo Google Jump camera footage in this Mocha VR 360 video tutorial.

_This tutorial uses footage shot by Spherica, using their new Atlas VR rover._  Spherica is a VR studio that hasnâ€™t produced a single 360 experience without moving the camera since 2015. Spherica not only produces high quality 360 content, they have also designed proprietary stabilization and rover systems to achieve incredibly smooth camera motion on moving 360 content.
