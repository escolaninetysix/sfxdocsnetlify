Adobe After Effects 2019 has updated the bundled Mocha AE for advanced planar motion tracking and masking.  

In this short tech video, Mary Poplin explains how the workflow to get motion tracking data and masking data from Mocha to AE has been improved.  

To get data from Mocha AE to AE, use the "Create Tracking Data" or 'Create Masking Data" buttons in the plug-in interface.  "Copy to clipboard" is no longer used in the workflow.
