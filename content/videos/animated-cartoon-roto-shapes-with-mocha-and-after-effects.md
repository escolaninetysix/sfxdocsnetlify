In this short tutorial, Imagineer Systems Product Specialist, Mary Poplin,
uses **Mocha** to create animated roto-shapes to create a simplified and
stylized animated look in Adobe After Effects. This workflow is basic, and
uses simple **Mocha** masks with After Effects filters and solids. Mary also
shows you how to convert one selected layer with many **Mocha** masks to
separate layers, each with it's own named **Mocha** mask using an easily
available free script from crgreen.com. Software used: **Mocha AE CC**,
**Mocha Plus** or **Mocha Pro** Adobe After Effects Script used:
Separate_Masks_in_Layers.jsx script for AE via crgreen.com
