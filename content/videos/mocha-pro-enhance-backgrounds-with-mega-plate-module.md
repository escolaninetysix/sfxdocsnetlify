This in-depth VFX tutorial focuses on Mocha Pro 2020's newest feature: Mega Plates and the Adobe After Effects workflow. 

Product specialist, Mary Poplin shows how to planar motion track a scene, create an extra-large, stitched frame with the Mega Plate Module, remove foreground objects, and then export our tracking data to After Effects in a format that allows you to paint and work on the new Mega Plate. 

For specific steps to export tracking data for Mega Plate workflow in After Effects, please refer to the [Mocha Pro User Guide](https://borisfx.com/support/documentation/mocha/7.0.0/#megaplate_module "Mocha Pro User Guide").
