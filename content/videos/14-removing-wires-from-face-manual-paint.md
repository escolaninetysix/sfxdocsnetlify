We have saved one of the trickiest sections til last. Part 14 focuses on manual paint and removing the wire from over the face. This presents us with a lot of challenges, not least because the viewer's attention is naturally drawn to the face. This allows us to look at some of the most common Paint tools in Silhouette's toolbox.
