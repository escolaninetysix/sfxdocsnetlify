[Mocha Pro's](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/?collection=mocha-pro&product=mocha-pro) popular Insert Module gets a major update in the 2022 release with the addition of PowerMesh tracking. This new streamlined workflow simplifies screen inserts, match moves, logo tracking, and even digital makeup. 

Senior product specialist Mary Poplin walks you through new features including:

● Grid Warp interface for bending and distorting insert layer 
● 12 Composite/Blend modes
● PowerMesh driven warping to marry inserts to organic objects like faces and skin
● Now mesh tracking can be rendered with motion blur
● Improved sub-sampling render quality and motion blur

Get ready for a timesaving new workflow that brings tracked insert compositing to editing hosts like Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, and VEGAS Pro! Finish simple match moves in one AE effect without precomps.
