Transform your actor or actress into action hero with [ BCC
](/products/continuum/) Temporal Blur. You'll
learn how to use the filters in two different ways -- one as a motion blur,
the other as a body double or ghosting effect (think The Matrix). Customize
your effect using blur spread, falloff, threshold, bias, and compositing
modes. Plus, discover how Pixel Chooser allows you to selectively blur parts
of your footage.

Filters Used Include: Temporal Blur

Featured Unit: Time
