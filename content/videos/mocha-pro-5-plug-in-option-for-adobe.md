New **Mocha Pro 5** plug-in option for Adobe. Now Mocha Pro's advanced planar
tracking based tools can now be launched as a plug-in, direct from your After
Effects or Premiere Pro project.

No more file import/export required and your Mocha work is saved inside your
final project.

Even better workflow than Adobe bundled Mocha AE: The Mocha Pro 5 plug-in
greatly improves on Mocha AE by embedding planar tracking and masking directly
into the plug-in instead of launching stand alone application. This uses the
host media engine and project format, reducing the need for transcoding or
external file management.

For those running the Adobe bundled Mocha AE, Mocha Pro 5 adds advanced
modules: Lens, Insert, Remove, Camera Solve &amp; Stabilize.
