A quick look at what is new inside **Mocha** version 4.

A major change to **Mocha Pro's** workflow is being able to choose between
working on mono or stereoscopic projects. You can now import stereo 3D views
and track, roto and render, then export back to stereo.

**Mocha Pro's** Remove Module has been updated to now support object removal and clean plating on stereo 3D footage.
