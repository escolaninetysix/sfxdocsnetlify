The first in a 3-part series, Boris FX's own Paul Ezzy dives into creating a
photorealistic eye in Adobe After Effects. Using [ BCC Organic Strands
](/products/continuum-units/particles/) as the focal
point in Part I, Paul details how to create iris texture by manipulating
organic noise, strands direction, gradients, the opacity graph, movement, and
other individual control features. Plus, he'll teach you how to further
enhance your eye with blending techniques and the [ BCC Sphere effect
](/products/continuum-units/perspective/) to simulate
realistic lighting.

If you're tired of using stock images that don't allow you full creative
control, and want your next sci-fi, medical, horror, or nature project to be
eye-popping (pun intended), Part I of All About Eyes provides a solid
foundation. [ Download Project File. ](/training/free-presets-and-projects/)
