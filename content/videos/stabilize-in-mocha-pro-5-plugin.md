Mary Poplin, shows you how to stabilize with the new **Mocha Pro 5 plug-in**
inside of Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. This
tutorial covers creativestabilization, such as smoothing out camera movements
or stabilizing around moving objects, completely locking down shots, and
automatically replacing edge fill on planar backgrounds.

Lens, motion blur, noise, and artifacts can make stabilization a challenge,
but with **Mocha Pro 5** as a plug-in, you have the power of planar right on
your timeline.
