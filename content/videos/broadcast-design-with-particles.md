Michele Yamazaki tapped [ Boris Continuum Complete v8 AE ](/products/continuum/)'s state-of-the-art particle system effects to develop and enhance broadcast graphics in Adobe After Effects CS6. Using [ BCC Particle Emitter 3D ](/products/continuum-units/particles/) and other Boris Continuum Complete VFX filters in conjunction with After Effects' native 3D camera and lighting systems, Michele made ordinary graphics and titles pop off the screen in 3D particle bursts.
