Eran Stern (Stern FX) gives you a shot-by-shot breakdown of a 30-second travel/tourism spot. You'll see the original piece without filters, then rebuild it with [ BCC ](/products/continuum/) in Adobe Premiere Pro CC. Find out what his favorite new transitions are, how easy the single-track auto-animating transitions are to apply (drag &amp; drop!), and how to adjust ease-in and ease-out using the HUD (heads-up display). In addition, [ BCC Lens Correction ](/products/continuum-units/image-restoration/) quickly gets rid of the fish eye distortion of the Go Pro footage within seconds.
