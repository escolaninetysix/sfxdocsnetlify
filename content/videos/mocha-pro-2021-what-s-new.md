[Mocha Pro 2021](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/?collection=mocha-pro&product=mocha-pro "Boris FX Mocha Pro") is now available as a plugin for Adobe, Avid, supported OFX hosts, and as a standalone application. 

Ben Brownlee shows off the hotly-anticipated release which includes PowerMesh sub-surface tracking to tackle warped and organic surfaces with blazing speed and accuracy, AdjustTrack 2.0 to correct slipped or drifting tracks faster than ever before, more host export options thanks to the Alembic exporter, Python scripting inside the plugin, and more.
