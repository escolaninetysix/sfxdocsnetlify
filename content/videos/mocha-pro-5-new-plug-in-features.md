**Mocha Pro 5** can now be launched as a plug-in from within your favorite editing hosts.

New support for Avid Media Composer (AVX), Adobe Creative Cloud (After Affect
Effects &amp; Premiere Pro), and OFX* (Resolve, Nuke) allows users to launch a
Mocha session from within their project for a quick and efficient workflow.

* OFX support coming soon.

This new workflow uses the host media engine and project format, reducing the
need for transcoding or external file management. Now Media Composer and
Premiere users can enjoy the same Mocha tools inside their edit timeline.

Mocha Pro 5 plug-in features: Planar Tracking • Roto • Object Removal •
Stabilize • Insert • Lens • 3D Camera

Both the standalone and plug-in options can render and export tracking, roto,
and camera data to most industry formats.
