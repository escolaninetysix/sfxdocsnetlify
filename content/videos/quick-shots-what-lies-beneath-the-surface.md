Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you through the ins and outs of using
Mocha's surface tool when planar tracking. If you've never been quite sure of
what is going on when you are tracking, this will help clear up what the
surface and the spline are doing in relation to the tracking data.This video
is useful for all Mocha products: Mocha AE, Mocha Pro and Mocha HitFilm.
