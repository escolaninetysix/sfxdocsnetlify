[Sapphire 11](/products/sapphire/) is the most significant release of Sapphire in years, bringing the Academy Award-winning Mocha tracking, masking and rotoscoping toolset into host applications including Flame for the first time. Every Sapphire effect, where appropriate, now has a built-in Mocha masking module for easy isolation, and a dedicated Mocha Spark places the power of Mocha at the heart of Flame's Timeline and Batch workspaces for fluid interaction with native tools. The new Mocha Spark also enables the export of complex roto shapes as GMasks and the export of Mocha planar tracking and stabiliser data to Action. Watch this short introduction video to learn all about these exciting new features.
