Part 7 looks at an aspect of wire removal that used to be done entirely with Paint, but can now be done much more efficiently using Mocha's PowerMesh. Removing wires from areas that have dynamic lighting or change shape or rotate, can be very difficult to do invisibly. We use Mocha PowerMesh to create an entirely stabilized area to paint on, even though the movement is far from planar! This is an essential step for complex wire removal.
