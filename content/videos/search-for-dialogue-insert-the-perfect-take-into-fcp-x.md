Soundbite quickly and
accurately finds any word or phrase spoken in recorded media. Video editors,
producers, and journalists can instantly play all occurrences of a spoken
phrase in their media, then insert the perfect take into their FCP or Premiere
Pro project.

In this tutorial, Steve Kanter demonstrates Soundbite's audio indexing features and
how the resulting XML data can be imported into Final Cut Pro X.
