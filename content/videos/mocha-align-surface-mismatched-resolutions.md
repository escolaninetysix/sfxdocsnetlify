Does your planar tracking look good in Mocha Pro or Mocha AE, but the screen does not line up in After Effects? Learn how to solve common mismatched Mocha corner pin issues in After Effects.

When a source insert is not the same size as the After Effects composition, the tracking data pasted in from Mocha will be misaligned relative to the difference in the source. In this tutorial, Mary Poplin covers 2 simple ways to solve this issue that works for both Mocha AE and Mocha Pro inside Adobe After Effects. These workflows will also work in most other host applications.

**Align Surface method.** Align your insert in your host, precompose or nest your insert depending on the host, and in Mocha, use the Align Surface tool on the same frame you synced up in your host, then apply the corner pin to the entire precomped or nested layer. This technique is also very useful for paint fixes.

**Fit to Comp method**. In this technique, you scale the insert layer to the size of the comp. Precompose or nest the insert, and then apply a Mocha corner pin that fits exactly to the area you want your insert to be.
