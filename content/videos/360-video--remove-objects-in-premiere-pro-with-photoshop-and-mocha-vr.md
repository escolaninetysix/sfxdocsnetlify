Find out how Adobe Photoshop's new spherical panorama features are an excellent complement to [Mocha VR](/products/mocha-pro/) for replacing unwanted objects in a 360 video scene.

The Mocha VR plug-in inside [Adobe Premiere Pro](/videos/?tags=host:Adobe%20Premiere%20Pro,product:Mocha,product:Mocha%20VR&search=) is used for the 360 tracking and object removal. Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 is used for the cloning and paint.
