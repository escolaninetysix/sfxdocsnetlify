Our paint is a high dynamic range non-destructive 2D paint system that handles the demands of feature film and 4K television production. Whether itâ€™s image restoration, dust busting, matte painting, beauty work, rig removal or just plain paint, Silhouette provides the artistic tools to get the job done.

Auto Paint is a unique paint feature that records all paint activity with tight integration of both point and planar trackers. Paint strokes can be match moved or stabilized, giving Silhouette the speed of raster paint with the repeatability of vector paint.
