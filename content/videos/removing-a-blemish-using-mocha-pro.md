Mocha guru, Mary Poplin discusses Imagineer Systems' Remove Module, available
in Mocha Pro. In this short tutorial, Mary will walk you through a medium
difficulty shot with no tracking markers, plenty of lighting shifts, and lots
of motion... using only a single cleanplate. "Mocha Pro is really great for
beauty work, and with a little practice, you can get the traditionally time
consuming job that is "roto paint" down to only a few minutes."
