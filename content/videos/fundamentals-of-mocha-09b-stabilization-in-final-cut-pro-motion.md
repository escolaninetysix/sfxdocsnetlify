What you'll learn: • Use Stabilize in Mocha, Final Cut Pro &amp; Apple Motion
• Workaround limitations in Final Cut Pro • Creating a smoothed shot This
tutorial is all about Stabilization; how it can help us in Mocha and how we
can use the tracking data in Final Cut and Motion. The limitations in FCP are
explored again and workarounds are discussed. Once again though, Motion gives
us the flexibility and offers more solutions. We see how to add animation to
Motion's "Behaviors" to create a smoothed shot, which maintains the camera
move but takes out the bumps. We then see a couple of quick ideas to fill in
missing edge details without scaling up too much. Finally we look at an
extreme stabilization of position, scale and rotation and a useful Behavior to
smooth the shot without adding keyframes.
