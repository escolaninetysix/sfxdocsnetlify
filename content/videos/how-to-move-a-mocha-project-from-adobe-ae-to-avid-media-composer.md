Export and move a [Mocha Pro](/products/mocha-pro/) project from one host application to another. Watch as Mocha Product Manager Martin Brennand shows you how to move a project from Adobe AE to Avid.

Using the example of porting a sky replacement project created within an Adobe After Effects environment to Avid Media Composer, Martin covers setting up the project, prepping any additional content (such as inserts) and the differences between merging a project over a simple open.

Mocha Pro can share projects across hosts: Adobe, Avid and OFX (Nuke, Fusion, HitFilm, Vegas Pro, etc).
