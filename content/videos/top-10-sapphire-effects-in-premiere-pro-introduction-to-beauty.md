Join Nick Harauz of clipsandhandles.com as he takes an introductory look at
Sapphire’s Beauty effect in Adobe Premiere Pro. Sapphire Beauty uses edge
aware blur technology to clean up skin tones while still retaining the details
of a person’s features. Nick will guide you through the parameters of Beauty,
demonstrating how to integrate Adobe Premiere Pro’s mask and tracking tools to
achieve a photorealistic cosmetic clean up. Be sure to visit genarts.com to
