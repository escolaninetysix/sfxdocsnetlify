In part 2 of this tutorial, you'll learn how to use MochaBlend-C4D's 'Camera
Map Editor' to turn a Mocha roto-shape and its linked-track into a 3D object
in C4D that moves in 3D space just like the original object moved in the real
world. You'll also learn how to keyframe the motion of a roto-layer if you
don't have a good track in Mocha, and how to add depth and rotation to the
layer.
