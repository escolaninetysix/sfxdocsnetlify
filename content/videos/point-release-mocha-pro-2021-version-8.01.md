**Mocha Pro 2021 v8.0.1:**

* Launch as Mocha Pro from After Effects: Customers with a valid Mocha Peo 2021 license can launch Mocha Pro 2021 instead of Mocha AE when choosing Track in Boris FX Mocha from the After effects animation menu. Set in preferences.


* Project File Optimization. Dense PowerMesh projects will now load and save faster. 


* Insert Module: Pre-multiply options for Insert module: New check box to the Insert module to specify whether an insert clip alpha should be pre-multiplied to help reduce fringing on insert renders.


* PowerMesh: Mesh regeneration warnings: Mocha now shows a warning message box if regeneration of mesh will destroy existing mesh tracking keys.


* Daily Tips in Welcome Screen: Daily tips now have clickable links when a URL is in the tip.


* Silhouette Project Import: To avoid confusion, weâ€™ve renamed the Silhouette project import menu Import shapes option to "Import SFX Shapes". 

**Fixes:** 

* Adobe After Effects: Fixed offset issue when working with trimmed source layers in AE comp. 


* Flame: Fixed Gmask Tracer keyframe issues. 


* Alembic: Fixed multiple Alembif offset and ref frame issues. 


* Avid Media Composer: Fixed issue where Mocha UI was hidden by Avid interface. 


* OFX: Fixed license activation issue when activating from within the Mocha user interface.
