**Mocha Pro 5** now has an improved license system that allows users to easily "activate &amp; deactivate" their license for more flexibility.

Mocha users that wish to move their v5 license across different CPU's can
simply activate for working, than deactivate to move the license to another
computer with an online internet connection.

Mocha Pro 5 is now available as a plug-in option OR standalone application.
