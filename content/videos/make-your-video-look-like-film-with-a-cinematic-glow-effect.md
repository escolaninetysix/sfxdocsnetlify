with [ BCC 8 AVX ](/products/continuum/) 's new Film Glow filter, a powerful yet very easy-to-
use effect. Make your highlights bloom and shadows spread out as you

designed presets included with the filter. Use [ BCC Film Glow
](/products/continuum-units/film-style/) to marry two
clips shot on different cameras or set the mood for an entire project.
