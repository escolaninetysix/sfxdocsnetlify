MediaMotion Ball and International Media Users Group (IMUG) founder, Carey Dissmore gives you an inside look at how he created this year's animated logo.

Armed with [ BCC 8 AE ](/products/continuum/) in Adobe After Effects, you'll learn how Carey harnessed the power of [ BCC Extruded EPS ](/products/continuum-units/3d-objects/) , [ BCC Particle Emitter 3D ](/products/continuum-units/particles/) , [ BCC Glint ](/products/continuum-units/lights/) , [ BCC Organic
Strands ](/products/continuum-units/particles/) , and [
BCC Colorize Glow ](/products/continuum-units/stylize/)
to create the slick, high energy style for the annual NAB event.
