New in [Continuum 2022](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/?collection=continuum&product=continuum "Continuum | Boris FX | World's most complete plugin suite for Adobe, Avid and OFX")!

Working inside Continuum has never been faster. Under the hood improvements including Adobe Multi-Frame Rendering support in After Effects, native Apple M1 support, and even more fully-GPU effects deliver huge speed increases across all hosts.
