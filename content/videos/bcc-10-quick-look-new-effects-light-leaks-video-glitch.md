New in Boris Continuum Complete 10 are two effects: ** BCC Light Leaks **
&amp; ** BCC Video Glitch **

** Light Leaks ** creates organic and naturalistic “in-camera” light and exposure effects to stylize and enhance your footage.

** Video Glitch ** makes footage look bad in the best way. Glitch creates the distressed look of compression artifacts, signal loss and corrupt digital video.

BCC 10 is available for Avid Media Composer, Adobe After Effects, Adobe
Premiere Pro, Blackmagic Resolve, Blackmagic Fusion, Nuke, Sony Vegas.

Filters Used Include:

BCC Light Leaks, BCC Video Glitch.
