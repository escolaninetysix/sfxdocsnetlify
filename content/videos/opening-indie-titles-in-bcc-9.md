In the first of his 3-part series on [ BCC 9 ](/products/continuum-complete/) in Premiere Pro CC, Eran Stern (Stern FX) creates an opening title sequence for an indie you can imagine premiering at Sundance.

Get an inside look at his creative process and workflow. Apply [ BCC 2-Strip Color ](/products/continuum-units/film-style/) and [ BCC Vignette ](/products/continuum-units/film-style/) to set the tone of the overall sequence. Add BCC Fast Film Glow to the titles and composite over the footage to create more depth. Use BCC Displacement Map, add transitions, and lots more.

Filters Used Include: [ BCC 2-Strip Color ](/products/continuum-units/film-style/) , BCC Burnt Film, [ BCC Color Match ](/products/continuum-units/color-and-tone/) , [ BCC Correct Selected Color ](/products/continuum-units/color-and-tone/) , BCC Displacement Map, [ BCC Fast Film Glow ](/products/continuum-units/film-style/) , [ BCC Hue-Sat-Lightness ](/products/continuum-units/color-and-tone/) , [ BCC Levels Gamma ](/products/continuum-units/color-and-tone/) , [ BCC Linear Luma Key ](/products/continuum-units/key-and-blend/) , [ BCC Pyramid Blur ](/products/continuum-units/blur-and-sharpen/) , and [ BCC Vignette ](/products/continuum-units/film-style/)
