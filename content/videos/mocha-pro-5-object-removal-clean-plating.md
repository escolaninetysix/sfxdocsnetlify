Mocha Pro’s Remove Module is an alternative to traditional clone and paint
techniques for getting rid of unwanted pixels and removing objects. It
automatically detects and blends pixels from other frames with little user
input, offering massive time savings.

Remove Module Features:

Auto Remove: Automatically finds clean frames within a clip to remove objects
based on planar tracking and motion keyer

Frame Range: Sets before/after search for finding “clean frames”

Illumination Modeling: Analyzes surrounding pixel values to match brightness
and lighting shifts on removed area.

Clean Plate: Import and interpolate cleaned frames for greater flexibility and
advanced object removal tasks.

New in Mocha Pro 5 is the plug-in option for Adobe, Avid and coming soon OFX
