Boris Continuum Complete has a PixelChooser with integrated Mocha planar tracking & masking tools.

Track and mask with less keyframes!

Editors can isolate any BCC filter with tracked masks for fast & efficient effects using Mocha's Academy award-winning tracking engine. Access Mocha power directly inside the BCC plug-ins. No import, export needed.

Mocha planar tracking data can also be used to loads into many BCC filters: Track lens flares, corner pins, even titles and graphics.
