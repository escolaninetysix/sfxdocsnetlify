Boris FX is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the introduction of planar tracking to the film and video industry. Widely used for ease of use and accuracy, “planar tracking” has become a standardized term in video post-production with [Mocha’s](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/?collection=mocha-pro&product=mocha-pro) unique and proprietary algorithm leading the way. 

For 20 years, Mocha’s innovative planar tracking technology has been used by professional visual effects for match moving, rotoscoping, set replacement, object removal, digital makeup, image stabilization, and much more.
