To celebrate the 4th of July this week, Paul Ezzy teaches you how to quickly
create a fireworks display in Adobe After Effects to add to your hometown
skyline (simply swap out the image).

Based on [ BCC Particle Emitter 3D ](/products/continuum-units/particles/) , you'll create four different displays - from
basic to explosive that rival the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular. Plus,
learn how [ BCC Cartooner ](/products/continuum-units/art-looks/) or [ BCC Pencil Sketch ](/effects/continuum-pencil-sketch/) give you the freedom of using custom shapes. [
