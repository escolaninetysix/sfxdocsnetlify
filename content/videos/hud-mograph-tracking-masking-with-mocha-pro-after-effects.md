Ian Robinson, certified Adobe master trainer, shows how [Mocha Pro's](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/ "Boris FX Mocha Pro") planar tracking and masking tools can be used to integrate futuristic HUD graphics to a scene. Learn how Mocha can handle deep depth of field and out-of-focus details, and how to stylize the composite with [Sapphire](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/ "Boris FX Sapphire") & [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Boris FX Continuum") plug-ins.

Mocha's planar tracking can solve out-of-focus shots that might throw off the AE point tracker or camera tracking. This 42 min project tutorial covers planar motion tracking, linking masks, open spline masking for hair and more.
