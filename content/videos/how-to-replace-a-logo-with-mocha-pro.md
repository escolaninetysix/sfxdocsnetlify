In this in depth tutorial, Mary Poplin of imagineer systems shows you how to
use Mocha Pro's Remove Module and Insert Module for logo replacement. We talk
about what to watch out for when tracking fabric, how to use cleanplates with
a remove, and how to use the grid warper tool to render out a logo pass with
warp and motion blur. Mary also walks you through finishing a shot by removing
existing frozen grain and re-matching the original grain on your removes and
inserts. The techniques are shown in AE, but are the same compositing concepts
for any system including Nuke, Fusion or Autodesk. Software used: Mocha Pro
After Effects Photoshop
