Learn how to use Mocha Pro's mesh tracking feature to add a face mask to a moving subject with realistic warping and tracked motion. PowerMesh is a new addition to Mocha's powerful planar tracking, designed for organic and warped surface tracking. 

Here, Mocha guru, Mary Polin covers useful mesh tracking tips including vertice editing, pre-comping the source layer in AE, and more. 

This tutorial is shown in After Effects, but a similar workflow will work running the Mocha Pro plugin inside Adobe Premiere Pro, Nuke, Vegas Pro, Fusion, and other hosts.
