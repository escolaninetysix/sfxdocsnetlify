**Mocha Pro 2019.5** now supports Autodesk Flame 2020 as an OFX plug-in. Launch the Mocha Pro interface directly from Flame for powerful planar tracking, masking, object removal, stabilization, 360/VR support and more.

In this tutorial, Dan Harvey reviews the general workflow to launch the Mocha Pro plug-in, exchange data and render shots.

Mocha Pro can export:

* Planar tracking data,
* Flame GMASKs for roto
* BX for 3D camera solves.

Mocha Pro can render shots directly to Flame: 

* Lens Correction
* Inserts with Mesh Warp
* Object Removal
* Stabilization

Did you know? Boris FX Sapphire and Mocha Pro can share Mocha project setups for workflow compatibility!
