Armed with [ BCC ](/products/continuum/) and [ Boris RED ](/products/red/) inside Adobe Premiere Pro, twenty-year
commercial production vet and award-winning Greg Walton teaches you how to
quickly and efficiently add layers of filters to a 30-second client spot with
20 shots.

Walton, a veritable one man show, shoots, edits, and finishes client projects
all himself. Editors, if you think you don't have time, think again.

multiple video and still images in RED.
