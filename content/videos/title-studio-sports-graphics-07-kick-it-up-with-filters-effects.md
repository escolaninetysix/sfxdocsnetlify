Add eye candy to the rendered 3D model using [Particle Illusion](https://borisfx.com/products/particle-illusion/ "Boris FX Particle Illusion") to create a quick, engaging motion background. Then dive into the [Continuum Lights Unit](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-units/lights "Boris FX Lights Unit") effects to add sparkles, shine, and overall cool factor to the project using Edge Lighting and Lens Flare 3D.
