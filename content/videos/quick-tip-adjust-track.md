In this short and advanced tutorial, MaryPoplin, imagineer systems Product
specialist, shows you how to use adjust track on simple and complex planar
tracks to correct drift and other tracking problems. There will be times when
tracks can drift due to lack of detail or introduction of small obstructions.
When this occurs, manual refinements can be made by using the AdjustTrack
tool. To achieve an adjusted track you would ideally line up the surface area
where you want to place your insert or lock down your roto. In situations
where you donâ€™t require an insertion you should place the corners of the
surface area in distinctive locations, as you will need to refer to these
locations when you add keyframes to correct the drift. When you have the
Surface where you want it to stay locked and are ready to refine the track,
flip over into the AdjustTrack module by hitting the AdjustTrack tab... then
follow these handy instructions!
