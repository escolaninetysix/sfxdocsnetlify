Vin Morreale from Boris FX shows how to take a still movie poster image and
bring it to life with subtle motion, particles and effect plug-ins. BCC Layer
deformer is used to animate the motion and BCC Snow filter is used for
particle animation. The end result also includes Fast Film Glow and Vignette
filters.  
  
3D Objects and Particles are found in Boris Continuum Complete 10 and
available for Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro &amp; After Effects, Apple
FCPX, Sony Vegas Pro, DaVinci Resolve and more.
