In response to a question on the Avid Community Forums, Boris FX Senior Product Manager Dirk de Jong illustrates a simple way to apply masks to a container element within the Avid FX or [ Boris RED ](/products/red/) environment by exploiting the pre-composition function. Pre-composition is a simple, powerful way to manipulate containers - very useful when compositing in Avid FX or [ Boris RED ](/products/red/) .
