Avid Certified Instructor Jeff Greenberg recently demonstrated why he just
can't live without [ Boris Continuum Complete ](/products/continuum/) 's
Correct Selected Color filter in Avid Media Composer. Using [ BCC Correct
Selected Color ](/products/continuum-units/color-and-tone/) , Jeff showed two examples of how to isolate a color in an image and
then perform secondary color correction - a technique made popular by
Schindler's List.

Filters Used Include: Correct Selected Color

Featured Unit: Color &amp; Tone
