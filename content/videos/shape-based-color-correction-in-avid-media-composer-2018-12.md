The newly released Avid Media Composer 2018.12 includes a new shape-based color correction tool. Shape-based tools are essential for isolating color correction.  

Ross Shain gives three examples of using Media Composer's native tools for garbage mattes and secondary corrections. Also includes advanced masking and effects isolation using the Mocha tools integrated directly inside [Sapphire](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/ "Boris FX - Sapphire") and [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Boris FX - Continuum") for a high-end finishing workflow.
