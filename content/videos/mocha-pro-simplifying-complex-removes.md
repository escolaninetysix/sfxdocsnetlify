In this brief tutorial (less than 5 minutes!), Mocha product specialist, Mary Poplin, shows you how to quickly "remove a puppet rig" using Mocha Pro's Remove Module. Simplify object removes by isolating foreground shapes to create clean background pixels and automatically remove wires.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Mary explains Mocha's layer order to allow tracked layers to track through occlusions.</span>

While this tutorial uses the standalone Mocha Pro application, the exact same tasks can be accomplished with the Mocha Pro plug-in for Adobe, Avid, and OFX hosts.
