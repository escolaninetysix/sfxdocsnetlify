Product Specialist Vin Morreale creates a trippy, sci-fi title sequence using Continuum's Organic Strands particles inside Adobe After Effects. Customize the look by quickly adjusting parameters, adding 3D camera movement, and layering Film Glows and Lens Flares. Plus, see how easy it is to tweak your finished look to strike a completely different tone.

* Please note: Although Vin is working in the beta version of Continuum 11, all filters covered are available in the current version, Continuum 10. *
