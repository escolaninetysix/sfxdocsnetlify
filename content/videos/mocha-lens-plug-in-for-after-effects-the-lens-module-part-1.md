In part 1 of this tutorial, Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you through
how to calibrate a lens with the Mocha Lens Module and use it with the new
Mocha Lens plug-in supported with Mocha AE 3.1 and Mocha Pro 3.1. Topics
include: 1\. Calibrating a lens with the Lens Module. 2\. Exporting data to
After Effects to undistort lens-warped footage. See Part 2 for: 1\. Exporting
corner pin data from Mocha to After Effects when Lens distortion has been
removed. 2\. Warping corner pin data from Mocha in After Effects when Lens
distortion has not been removed.
