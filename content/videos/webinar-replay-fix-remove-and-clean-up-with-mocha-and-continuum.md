Previously recorded. One-hour free training.

Mary Poplin and Ross Shain team up to show Adobe Premiere Pro editors how using [Continuum 2019](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Boris FX - Continuum") and [Mocha Pro 2019](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/ "Boris FX - Mocha Pro ") helps you easily fix not-so-perfect footage, remove unwanted objects, and do clean-ups without having to leave your project timelines. _Techniques covered can be used regardless of what host application you're using._
