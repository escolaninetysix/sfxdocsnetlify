Product Specialist Mary Poplin shows how the Mocha Pro plug-in inside Adobe
After Effects and the new Sapphire 10 plug-ins from GenArts (now part of the
Boris FX family) can be used together to create a day for night conversion.

Covers: sky replacement, color correction, creating stylized looks with
Sapphire 10's new effects including Luna, Sapphire Builder, Lens Flares, and
more.
