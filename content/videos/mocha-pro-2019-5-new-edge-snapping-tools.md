**Mocha Pro 2019.5** now features Edge-Snapping splines for enhanced roto and masking shots. After creating a Mocha shape, use the following keyboard shortcuts to activate edge-snap:

**Alt+S keys to snap selected control points**

OR

**Hold S key for snap drag selected points**

Follow along with Mocha specialist, Mary Poplin in this quick tutorial and learn how to roto with fewer keyframes. Choose from Bezier, X-Spine, magnetic spline or freehand tools. Link splines to planar tracking, then use edge-snapping to speed up the process.

New Edge-Snapping functionality is found in Mocha Pro 2019.5 and will soon be included in Boris FX's upcoming [Continuum ](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Continuum")and [Sapphire](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/ "Sapphire") 2019.5 releases.
