Mocha VR 5.6 has improved the Reorient Module for stabilizing spherical 360 video.

Designed to reduce unstable motion, the  Reorient Module can drastically improve nausea-inducing VR experiences by smoothing or stabilizing shaky, handheld and drone captured footage.

New features include stereoscopic support and new "near-view" techniques for stabilizing difficult shots where the horizon is not visible or tracking areas are obscured and out of frame. Use multiple track layers across a clip to average and unwanted shakes & jitters.

Mocha VR is available as a standalone application or plug-in for Adobe After Effects & Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer and OFX Hosts: Nuke, Fusion, Vegas Pro & HitFilm Pro.
