Ben Brownlee shows you how to create a completely unique look using the free [Particle Illusion](https://borisfx.com/products/particle-illusion/ "Boris FX Particle Illusion") presets. Use this as a stepping stone to creating your own new emitters.

You will learn the importance of what to look for when finding the right starting preset. Then we change up the look, colors, and behaviors of the multiple particle types that make up one single emitter. We also look at the differences between parameters and parameter variation. Finally, we render and save out our Particle Illusion project and use it in our edit.
