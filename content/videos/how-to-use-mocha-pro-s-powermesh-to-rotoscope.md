Mary Poplin shows how to save tons of time by pairing [Mocha Pro's](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/?collection=mocha-pro&product=mocha-pro "Mocha Pro | Boris FX | Planar motion tracking plugin") new PowerMesh together with rotoscoping to apply detailed color to a line art tattoo. 

The technique is shown inside Adobe After Effects, but can be used in any host that supports roto shapes and colorization with blending modes, like Nuke, Fusion, and more.
