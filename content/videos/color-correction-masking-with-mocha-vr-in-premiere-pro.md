In this tutorial Mocha Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you through using Mocha VR for tracking and masking to isolate specific areas for shadows and highlight correction in VR footage with Lumetri color grading tools inside Adobe Premiere Pro.

Mocha VR is a new plug-in that runs inside of both Adobe Premiere Pro CC and After Effects CC for 360 video tracking, masking, rig removal and stabilization. Work in lat/long and rectilinear 360 space for efficient workflow.
