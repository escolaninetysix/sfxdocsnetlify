Sapphire's Beauty filter applies smoothing, color correction, soft focus, and glow to skin regions. Skin regions are based on the value of Enable Skin Detection and whether a second input is provided. If Enable Skin Detection is on, the plugin generates an internal matte from the Skin Color, Luma and Chroma Range parameters. The second input is an optional matte, that if connected the effect only applies to bright areas of the matte (if Enable Skin Detection is on and a matte is provided the two are multiplied).
