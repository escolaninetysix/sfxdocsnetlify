Many [ Boris Continuum Complete ](/products/continuum-complete/) effects mimic real-world situations, and [ BCC Lens Blur ](/products/continuum-units/blur-and-sharpen/) is no exception. It's an effect that is created when a camera is out of focus, and the highlights in the frame take on the shape of the camera's lens. In this tutorial, we take a shot that already has this effect done in camera, and improve on it to create a new, eye-catching look.
