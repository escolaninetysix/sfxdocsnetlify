Join John Dickinson of Motionworks.net as he takes an introductory look at the
Sapphire DigitalDamage effect in Adobe After Effects. DigitalDamage creates a
highly customizable glitchy look that simulates a digital transition error.
John will guide you through the parameters of DigitalDamage to create a subtle
damaged look and howÂ to apply this effect to titles to quickly create a
fractured look. Be sure to visit genarts.com to learn more about Sapphire
plug-ins for Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer,
Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke by The Foundry, and many
more!
