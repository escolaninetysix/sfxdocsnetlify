In this tutorial, Mocha specialist Mary Poplin shows how she speeds up her After Effects roto and masking projects with the new magnetic & freehand spline tools in **Mocha Pro 2019**.

The magnetic spline tool speeds up roto & masking with edge snapping to quickly create accurate roto shapes. Combined with the power of planar motion tracking = massive time savings! 

The project is complimented by Sapphire Builder effects running inside of Adobe After Effects. Mary finishes the spot by linking planar tracking data to text for a vacation promo look.
