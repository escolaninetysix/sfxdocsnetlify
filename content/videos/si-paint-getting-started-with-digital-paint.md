[Silhouette Paint](https://borisfx.com/products/silhouette-paint/) allows you to create a huge number of different tasks without the speed issues normally associated with digital paint.

Get to know the typical workflow for set extensions and clean-ups. Start from a new project, choose the right paint tools, and use Auto Paint to paint across multiple frames. Plus when you use Silhouetteâ€™s specialized tools and when traditional compositing will give you a faster result.

Silhouette Paint is available as a plugin for Adobe and OFX or as part of the standalone Silhouette application.
