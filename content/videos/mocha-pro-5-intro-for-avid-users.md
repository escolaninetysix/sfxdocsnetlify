This quick video tutorial was created to show Avid Media Composer editors how
to get started with the **Mocha Pro 5 plug-in**. Mocha Pro AVX plug-in is
applied in Media Composer and the custom interface is launched.

For learning Mocha, we recommend watching the "Mocha Fundamentals" training
video series:
