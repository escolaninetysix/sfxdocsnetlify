Join John Dickinson of Motionworks.net as he takes an introductory look at the
Sapphire LensFlare effect in Adobe After Effects. LensFlare creates a highly
customizable lighting element on your footage thanks to the LenFlare Designer,
an easy to use application that allows you to break down your flare into
individual editable elements. John will guide you through the parameters of
LensFlare and demonstrate the workflow he uses when integrating this effect
into his footage. Be sure to visit genarts.com to learn more about Sapphire
plug-ins for Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer,
Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke by The Foundry, and many
more!
