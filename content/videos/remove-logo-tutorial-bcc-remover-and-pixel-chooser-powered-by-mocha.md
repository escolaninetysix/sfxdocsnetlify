Boris Continuum Complete 10 (BCC) has new tools for image restoration such as
removing unwanted objects.

In this slow paced tutorial, Mary Poplin shows you how to use the new BCC
Remover plug-in to clone out an unwanted sign and the integrated Mocha masking
tools to roto-mask the foreground back on top.

Mocha planar tracking and masking tools are integrated into the BCC
PixelChooser and found inside almost every BCC effect.
