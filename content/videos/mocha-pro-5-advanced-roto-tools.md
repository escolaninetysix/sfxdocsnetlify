Mocha's X-spline and Bezier creation tools are purposely designed for artists
to easily create detailed roto shapes. When linked to planar tracking, roto
shapes inherit motion and perspective, dramatically reducing manual keyframe
work. Advanced tools for shape editing include per-point edge feathering, open
splines, join layers tool, transform tool, group layers and more making Mocha
Pro the ideal system for rotoscoping.
