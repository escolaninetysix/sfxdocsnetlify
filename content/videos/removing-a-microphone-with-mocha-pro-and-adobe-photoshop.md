In this short and clear video tutorial, Mary Poplin goes over the basics of
removing and unwanted object with **Mocha Pro**. Only 1 clean frame is painted
in Adobe Photoshop and than **Mocha Pro**'s Planar Tracking and Remove Module
does the hard work of matching the perspective and lighting. This technique is
a huge time saver for artists and editors that need to fix footage and remove
unwanted objects from a shot.
