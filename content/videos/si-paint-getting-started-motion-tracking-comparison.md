[Silhouette Paint](https://borisfx.com/products/silhouette-paint/) offers three types of motion tracking including [award-winning Mocha planar tracking](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/). Solid motion tracking data is vital to good digital paint.

Learn how each of these trackers works, how they differ, and which one is most useful depending on what youâ€™re working on. Plus how to check if your tracking is good enough to use with Auto Paint.

Silhouette Paint is available as a plugin for Adobe and OFX or as part of the standalone Silhouette application.
