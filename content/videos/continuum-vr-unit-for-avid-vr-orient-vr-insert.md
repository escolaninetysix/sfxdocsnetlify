Join Nick Harauz, Avid certified trainer, for a look at two of the five filters included in the [Continuum VR Unit](/products/continuum-units/continuum-vr/ "Continuum VR Unit"):

**VR Reorient**  
Use the VR Reorient filter to re-position or center the hero view, fix footage shot at angles or drones, and flatten the horizon.  

**VR Insert**  
VR Insert allows users to easily insert a secondary source clip, title, logo, etc. into a 360/VR shot in true 360/VR space in either mono or stereo format in addition to providing a full array of controls to reorient the source in 360/VR space.
