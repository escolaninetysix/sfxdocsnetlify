New in Boris Continuum Complete 10 are four transition effects:  ** Cross Zoom
** , ** Cross Melt ** , ** Cross Glitch ** , and ** Light Leaks Dissolve ** .

All BCC transitions come with multiple factory installed presets that can be
customized and shared across projects.

BCC 10 is currently available for Avid and Adobe. OFX and other hosts are
