Mary Poplin walks you through an advanced tutorial using Mocha Pro's Remove
Module and clean plate function to remove tracking markers on a typical vfx
shot. Skills addressed include rotoscoping and removing in Mocha Pro, painting
in Photoshop, and basic After Effects compositing workflow from Mocha Pro to
AE. Footage from "The Fisherman and His Soul" courtesy of Luiz Eduardo Mihich
Do you have footage you'd like me to solve in a tutorial or use for demos?
