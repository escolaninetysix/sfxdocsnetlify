Join John Dickinson of Motionworks.net as he takes an introductory look at the
Sapphire Shake effect in Adobe After Effects. Shake adds a highly customizable
camera shake to add lots of energy to your footage. John will guide you
through the parameters of Shake to demonstrate how to use this effect on
footage or motion graphics projects as a great timesaver. Be sure to visit
genarts.com to learn more about Sapphire plug-ins for Adobe After Effects,
Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Autodesk
