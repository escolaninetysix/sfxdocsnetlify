In this video, Adobe certified trainer, Nick Harauz, shows you the ins and outs of three VR filters included in the VR Unit from Boris FX.

**VR Sharpen**  
The VR Sharpen filter provides the highest quality 360 video sharpening available in a plugin. It uses state-of-the-art image algorithms to enhance image detail while minimizing artifacts associated with traditional sharpening tools.

**VR Flicker Fixer**  
The VR Flicker Fixer filter provides 3 different methods for removing flicker.

**VR Blur**  
The Blur filter generates out-of-focus effects by emulating the look of shooting with soft focus or a lens diffusion filter. Designed from the ground up to operate in 360/VR with multiple edge wrap modes to process pixels that reside along the edge of the 360 seam.
