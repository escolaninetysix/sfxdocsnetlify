Using After Effects and **Mocha AE**, Product Manager Martin Brennand shows
you how to track and replace an actor's eyes when they accidentally look at
the camera. Using similar techniques you can quickly track, mask and replace
performances, either to fix mistakes or to get creative with your shots.

This tutorial applies to**Mocha AE**, **Mocha Plu**s and **Mocha Pro**.
