In this advanced tutorial, Mocha guru, Mary Poplin, shows how to patch and
remove objects using Mocha Pro. Mary removes an unwanted element that is
challenged by partially obscured and out of focus foreground objects. This
tutorial assumes that you know the basics of planar tracking, roto-masking and
basic Adobe Photoshop. Also covers: berkey, feathered masks, and using the
Insert Module to create multi-layer patches. The Insert Module is found in
Mocha Pro. For more information, visit: www.imagineersystems.com Footage
