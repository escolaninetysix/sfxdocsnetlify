Continuum's Beat Reactor lets you sync and drive your effects to the beat of music without any keyframes! This means if you change your mind about a style or value, updating it takes seconds — and you never have to leave your Adobe Premiere Pro timeline.

Note: Beat Reactor is available in After Effects as a standalone plug-in, so you can link it to any values you want using expressions.
