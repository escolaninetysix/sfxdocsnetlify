The Media Composer 8.3 release brings ultra HD support - 2K &amp; 4K - to Avid editors for the first time. While the Avid Title Tool doesn't support these higher resolutions, [ Boris RED ](/products/red/) (formerly Avid FX) offers the perfect high quality titling solution. Senior Product Manager, Dirk de Jong, shows you just how sharp your titles will be.
