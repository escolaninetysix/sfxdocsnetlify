**Mocha Pro 5** now has the option to run planar tracking on GPU. Depending on the project settings, we are seeing 40-60% speed increases. This 4K test compares **Mocha Pro 5** running in CPU (on left) and on OpenCL GPU (on right).

**Test clip:** 4000x2160, 30 FPS **Video Card:** Nvidia Quadro M6000 24GB w/ driver version 364.72 **CPU Specs:** Intel Core i7 CPU 920@2.67GHz, 4 Core, 8 Logical Processors, 16GB RAM

To enable GPU tracking, you will need an OpenCL capable video card. _GPU
setting is found in preferences._
