Product Specialist, Mary Poplin walks you through a project she is currently
working on using **Mocha Pro** and **Adobe After Effects**. The goal is to
recreate a "Hobbit/Lord of the Rings" style look with simple DSLR footage shot
on a no-budget shoot. This is an advanced walkthrough, so it is recommended
that you know your way around **Mocha Pro** and **After Effects** before you
try to follow along. This entire shot took right around an hour from start to
finish, but has been sped up to around 20 minutes. Programs used are **Mocha
Pro** for object removes and roto work, After Effects for compositing, and
Photoshop for clean plate creation. AE plugins used are Neat Image to remove
grain and Magic Bullet Mojo for color. Footage is shot on a Canon 5D Mark ii
DSLR with a Canon 50mm lens. This is a really good example of how **Mocha**
plays nice with other tools in your toolbox in order to seriously speed up
your workflow.
