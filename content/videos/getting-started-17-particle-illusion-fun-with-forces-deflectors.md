[Particle Illusion](https://borisfx.com/products/particle-illusion/ "Boris FX Particle Illusion") comes packed with tons of elemental presets. It's legal, safe and easy to set things on fire with particles. Ben Brownlee shows you how to get great looking flames. Start by layering multiple emitters and tweaking the presets to get it looking right. You'll learn which of the settings are most important to change, and which ones you can leave at default.

At the end of this tutorial, we render out the flame footage and see how to composite it in the main project.
