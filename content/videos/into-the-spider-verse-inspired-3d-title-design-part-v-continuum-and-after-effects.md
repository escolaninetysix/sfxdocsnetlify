Add the final touches to your 3D title sequence! John Dickinson breaks down the dripping text reveal and paint drop effect, and how to use displacement effects to create a shockwave. 

Learn how to create and animate a drip matte; how to use CC Glass to create a puffy, wet paint look; how to use the Circle effect with CC Glass and BCC Displacement to create a shockwave; and how to stylize text using [Continuum's](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Boris FX Continuum") BCC Halftone, BCC Grunge, BCC Pin Art 3D and BCC Wooden Planks.
