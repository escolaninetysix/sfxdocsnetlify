Video editing and motion graphics training pro, Nick Harauz, gives you a quick look at two of the five filters included in the [Continuum VR Unit](/products/continuum-units/continuum-vr/ "VR editing tools from Boris FX"):

**1) VR Reorient**  
The VR Reorient filters makes it possible to reorient a 360/VR shot in true 360/VR space in either mono or stereo format. VR Reorient includes a set of intuitive overlay controls that map each section of the 360 source clip to its respective face in the 360 environment, emulating the view that a user would experience when consuming 360 media via a head mounted display system like Oculus Rift.  

**2) VR Insert**  
VR Insert allows users to easily insert a secondary source clip, title, logo, etc. into a 360/VR shot in true 360/VR space in either mono or stereo format in addition to providing a full array of controls to reorient the source in 360/VR space.
