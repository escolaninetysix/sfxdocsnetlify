What you'll learn:

  * Setup a new project
  * Create effective shapes for tracking
  * How the Planar Tracker tracks

Starting a project in **Mocha**, including tips on Pixel Aspect Ratio and
handling interlaced footage.

When tracking our first object, we see the importance of picking the right
size shape to track. We also see the separation between the shape we track and
the data that Mocha gives us. A focus of this exercise are the tracking
Parameters and how we adjust these to the footage we are tracking.
