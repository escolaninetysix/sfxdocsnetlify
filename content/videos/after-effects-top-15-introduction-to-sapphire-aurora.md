Join John Dickinson of Motionworks.net as he takes an introductory look at
Sapphireâ€™s Aurora effect in Adobe After Effects. Aurora can simulate Northern
and Southern Lights, but is also a versatile tool for creating lighting
effects and other organic elements. John will guide you through the parameters
of Aurora, and demonstrate how to create a beautiful close up of moving
flames. Be sure to visit genarts.com to learn more about Sapphire plug-ins for
Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic
Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke by The Foundry, and many more!
