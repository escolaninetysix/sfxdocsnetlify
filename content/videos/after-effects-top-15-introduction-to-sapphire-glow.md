Join John Dickinson of Motionworks.net as he takes an introductory look at the
Sapphire Glow effect in Adobe After Effects. Glow creates blooming light
effects from the brightest areas of your footage. John will guide you through
the parameters of Glow and demonstrates how to add atmosphere to the look and
combine this effect with Sapphire's Bokeh Lights to create additional lighting
elements. Be sure to visit genarts.com to learn more about Sapphire plug-ins
for Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic
Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke by The Foundry, and many more!
