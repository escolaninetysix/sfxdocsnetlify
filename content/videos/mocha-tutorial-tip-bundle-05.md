Imagineer Systems Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you though some of the
daily Mocha tips we've been posting to Twitter and Facebook. Learn more about
planar motion tracking, rotoscoping and visual effects! Footage has provided
by stockfootage.com: http://stockfootage.com/ Tips covered in this bundle:
13\. You can adjust the surface at any time and it will still move relative to
the tracking data, except when using manual mode. 14\. Moving the spline does
not move the tracking! The spline is only a search area, not the tracked data.
15\. View your surface and/or grid while tracking. It helps to see how the
track is going more accurately than the spline shape. You can check out the
daily tips here: twitter.com/imagineersystem Or here:
