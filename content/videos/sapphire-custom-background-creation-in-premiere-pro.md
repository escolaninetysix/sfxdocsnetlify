The Sapphire 2022.5 release added a ton of new Builder presets for motion backgrounds. Ben Brownlee shows how to use a preset as a jumping-off point to easily create a completely new and unique background with just a few tweaks.

Techniques are shown in Adobe Premiere Pro but apply in any supported Sapphire host application.
