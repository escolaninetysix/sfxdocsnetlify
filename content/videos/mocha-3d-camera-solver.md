**3D camera tracking for visual effects** Solve 3D match moving capabilities with planar ease. Unlike feature based tracking, **Mocha** solves the 3D camera based on "user-selected planes". This fast and easy-to-use solution is ideal for set extensions, 3D text and particle tracking. Additionally the 3D solver can be used to assist other 3D tracking applications on difficult shots with low detail or significant foreground occlusions. **Mocha Pro** camera solver can export 3D data to Adobe After Effects, HitFilm, Nuke, Flame, Smoke, and standard animation programs such as Cinema 4D, Maya and Blender. **Mocha Plus** camera solver exports to Adobe After Effects and HitFilm only.
