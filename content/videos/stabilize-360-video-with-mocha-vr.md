In this intermediate tutorial, Mocha Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you through smoothing the horizon in a Samsung Gear 360 shot using the Reorient Module in Mocha VR. Jittery 360 video footage can be made more watchable by stabilizing with Mocha's planar tracking tools.

The tutorial is done via the Adobe After Effects plug-in, but the techniques apply to all versions of Mocha VR.
