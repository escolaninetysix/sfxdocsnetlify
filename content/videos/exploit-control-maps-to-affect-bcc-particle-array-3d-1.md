Boris FX Senior Product Manager Dirk de Jong demonstrates how simple it is to
affect attributes of the array. By adding Control Maps as either a Graph or a
Layer Control or even both - the Layer Control being a reference to another
After Effects layer - the array can be manipulated and animated. Adding
Control Maps can make the array assume the shape of another layer as well as
affect many other attributes of the array.
