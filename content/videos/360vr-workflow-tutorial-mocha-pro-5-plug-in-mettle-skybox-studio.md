Imagineer Systems product specialist, Mary Poplin, shows 360 - Virtual Reality
post-production tips for Adobe users! Previews the upcoming Mocha Pro 5 plug-
in working with Mettle's Skybox Studio. In this tutorial, we show how to use
Mocha Pro for masking and tracking on equirectangular (LatLong) footage.
Skybox Studio is used to convert the distorted footage to a "flattened cubic
cross" view and the new Mocha Pro 5 plug-in is used for tracking &amp;
masking. **Note Mocha Pro 5 plug-in is now in beta testing and available soon.
Mocha Pro 5 plug-in will allow users to access Mocha via the host media engine
to avoid pre-rendering for a dynamic workflow in Adobe, Avid, Nuke &amp;
more.*** Learn more about [Mettle Skybox.](http://www.mettle.com) Thank you to
[Freedom360](http://freedom360.us/) for use of footage.
