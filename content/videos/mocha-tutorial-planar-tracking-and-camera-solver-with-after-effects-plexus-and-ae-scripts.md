Planar tracking, masking &amp; 3D camera solving. In this tutorial, Mary
Poplin uses Mocha Pro and After Effects to design a dynamic animated, tracked
graphic. She uses Mocha Pro for camera solve and object tracking in 3D, which
can then be exported to After Effects to drive the Plexus particle plug-in.
This tutorial features Mocha Pro, After Effects and Plexus Note: Mocha AE v3
can be used as well More info on Plexus at aescripts + aeplugins:
