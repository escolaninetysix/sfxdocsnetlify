If your client is asking for a [ 3D extruded logo animation ](/products/continuum-units/3d-objects/) in his video and all he has for company graphics is his business card, then you better dig deep into your toolbox. And you better find a copy of [ Boris RED ](/products/red/) in it because that is what you'll need to get this tough job done.
