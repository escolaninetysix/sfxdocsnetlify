Ben Brownlee walks Avid editors through how to take your less-than-perfect green screen footage to the final composited shot using the power of **Continuum's Primatte Studio** plugin. A 6-part training series.

Part I: Analyze your footage to identify any potential hiccups and quickly create an initial alpha channel with Auto Analysis and Primatte Studio's cleanup tools.

Continuum Primatte Studio is included in [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Boris FX Continuum") and is also available as an [individual plugin](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/ "Boris FX Continuum Primatte Studio plugin").
