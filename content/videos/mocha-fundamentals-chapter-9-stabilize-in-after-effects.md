What you'll learn:

  * Use Stabilize in Mocha &amp; After Effects
  * How to pick your focus point for Stabilization
  * Creating a smoothed shot

This tutorial is all about Stabilization; how it can help us in Mocha and how
we can use the tracking data in After Effects. We discuss how to shift
narrative focus within a shot just by changing the shape that we build the
stabilized effect on. This gives us a good deal of control in the scene. In
After Effects we see the methods for stabilizing position, then scale and
rotation using Expressions. We then work on creating a smoothed shot to
maintain the camera move but take out the bumps. Along with this, we see some
quick techniques for filling in missing edge details.
