The [Continuum](/products/continuum "Boris FX - Continuum") Broadcast Safe filter guarantees your Avid Media Composer projects will pass color and luma safe standards in any broadcast market. Simply apply the filter, select your preset, and render. Broadcast Safe uses a soft knee approach to maintaining color and luma safe levels unlike many of the solutions found in native NLEs. The default doesn't hard clip the output, allowing you to avoid crushing highlights in the final output.
