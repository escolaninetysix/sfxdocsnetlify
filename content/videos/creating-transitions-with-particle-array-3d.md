Ever wonder how seemingly random particles fly or whirl across the screen to
create an image? Senior Product Manager, Dirk de Jong, shows you how [ BCC
](/products/continuum/) [ Particle Array 3D
](/products/continuum-units/particles/) in Adobe After
Effects can be used to create the effect. Plus, learn the ins-and-outs of
fractal noise and control maps, and discover how [ BCC Film Glow

](/products/continuum-units/lights/) , [ BCC Linear Wipe
](/products/continuum-units/transitions/) , and BCC Rays
Puffy can be added for a highly stylized look that pops. [ Download Project
