What you'll learn:

  * Solve problems with interlaced footage
  * Pick the right type of shape for the Camera Solver
  * Set up correct parameters for the shot type
  * Check the solve quality in After Effects

Before we look at **Mocha's** Camera Solver, we fix issues with incorrectly
interpreted interlaced footage. Next we identify what the camera motion is in
the shot, to correctly create the type of tracked layers required to create
the virtual camera. In this tutorial the movement is Pan Tilt Zoom, so we
prepare the main track layer plus a track matte layer. Once the camera is
solved, we look at how to test it in After Effects using both a regular 3D
text layer and a 3D particle layer.
