Need to get up-and-running quickly with Mocha? Ben Brownlee, VFX artist and master trainer (Curious Turtle), guides Mocha users through the basics of Mocha’s powerful tools.

02:05 / What are we exporting?

04:41 / Offsetting the tracking data

05:44 / Understanding the different types of corner pin exports and how to use them

09:19 / Rendering directly in the host using the Mocha Pro plug-in filter
