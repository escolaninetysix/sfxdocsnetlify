Boris FX's Ross Shain draws inspiration from famous clips like Richard Linklater's "Scanner Darkly", Aha's "Take on Me" and Adult Swim's "Dream Corp LLC" to create a highly-stylized rotoscoped animated look. 

Learn how to use [Mocha Pro](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/ "Boris FX Mocha Pro") inside an After Effects workflow to planar track and segment the image into native AE mask layers. Save hours of time with less manual drawing and keyframing with Mocha's magnetic spline and edge-snapping tools.
