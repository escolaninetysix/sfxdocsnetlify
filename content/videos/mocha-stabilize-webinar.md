In this free, live webinar, Imagineer Systems product specialist, Mary Poplin
covers planar tracking stabilization techniques using Mocha AE, Mocha Pro, and
Mocha import+ for After Effects and Nuke. More than just a tracker! Use
Mocha's planar tracking tools to artistically stabilize or refocus your shots,
extend your sets, and more. Stabilization is a common problem editors and VFX
artists face in film and video post-production. Artists can use stabilization
to lock down a shot, refocus a shot, stabilize an area for easy visual effects
creation, or even extend the set. Often, stabilization requires time
consuming, multiple feature tracking, but Mocha offers an efficient solution;
with Mocha's planar tracker you can choose to lock off a camera, smooth the
camera out, or refocus the shot of important objects or people in a scene.
