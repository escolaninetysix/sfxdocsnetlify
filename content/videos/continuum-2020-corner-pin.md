New! [Boris FX Continuum 2020](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Boris FX Continuum")

The new Corner Pin Studio will change your corner pin and insert workflow for the better! It's now even easier to create screen/billboard inserts and replacements. Simply use the single Mocha planar tracker that targets the surface and four offset pins that help you make sure your final result is accurate. Includes blending modes for seamless compositing.
