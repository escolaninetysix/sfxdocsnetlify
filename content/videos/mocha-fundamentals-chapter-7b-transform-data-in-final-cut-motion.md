What you'll learn:

  * Export tracking data to Final Cut Pro &amp; Apple Motion
  * The limitations of Final Cut Pro plus some workarounds
  * Offsetting raw data in Motion

This tutorial shows how to take the tracked footage in **Mocha** and use that
data in Apple Final Cut Pro &amp; Motion. We start with a simple matchmove in
Final Cut Pro and quickly see the limitations in the way it handles keyframes.
Next we look at how to take the same data into Apple Motion. This is much more
flexible and higher quality than working in FCP alone. Finally we take the
project back into FCP to be used as part of the final edit.
