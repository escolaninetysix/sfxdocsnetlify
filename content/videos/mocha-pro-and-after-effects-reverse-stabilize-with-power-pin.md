Reverse stabilize your shots for clean-ups and more using [Mocha Pro's](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/ "Boris FX Mocha Pro") planar tracking. Mocha Pro 2019 now includes an Adobe After Effects CC Power pin export format which creates a simple workflow to quickly achieve a stabilized pre-comp.

If you're working with Mocha AE, the <a href="https://mamoworld.com/tools/mochaimport-after-effects" target="_blank">MochaImport+ script from Mamoworld</a> can be used to achieve a similar workflow.
