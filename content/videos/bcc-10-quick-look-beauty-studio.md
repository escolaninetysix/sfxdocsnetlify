New in Boris Continuum Complete 10 is ** Beauty Studio ** , an advanced skin
smoothing and retouching plug-in found under the BCC Image Restoration
toolset.

Beauty Studio allows editors to be the “digital makeup artist” and
realistically reduce unwanted or distracting details captured by HD or 4K
cameras. Using the Beauty Studio plug-in, shiny skin, blemishes, bumps and age
spots can be easily minimized while retaining the actors' natural details to
improve your talent and production quality.

For advanced retouching projects, the integrated Mocha masking inside Beauty
Studio allows the user to track skin texture and isolate unlimited details
within the one effect.
