Developed with Media Composer editors in mind, Sapphire Builder helps editors
create custom effects and transitions quickly and easily, and is fully
integrated within the Media Composer workflow. The result? The potential to
build endless, professional looks for increased production value. Damien
LeVeck (damienleveck.com/), an accomplished editor based in Los Angeles, CA
will walk you through how to use this revolutionary effect within your work.
