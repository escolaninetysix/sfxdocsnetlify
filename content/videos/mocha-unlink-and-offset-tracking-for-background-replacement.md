For replacing backgrounds or tracking out of focus regions, Mocha's **Unlink Workflow** is an incredibly powerful technique to learn. In this useful video tutorial, Mary Poplin shows how to track a handheld camera move and replace the background sky with Mocha's planar motion tracking in Adobe After Effects.

Keying was done with [Continuum's Primatte Studio](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/ "Boris FX Continuum Primatte Studio") plugin.

Unlink creates an offset relationship between the layer's search area (the spline) and the surface (the track). Create a layer, then in Layer Properties, select Link to Track: None. When you track, notice the search area will not move and you now have an offset relationship between the Spline and Surface.

This example is shown running the [**Mocha Pro**](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/ "Mocha Pro Plug-in") plug-in inside Adobe After Effects, but the unlink technique can be used in any version if Mocha plug-in or standalone application.
