Ben Brownlee, Director of Production & Learning, shows DaVinci Resolve users how to pull a perfect key using [Continuum's Primatte Studio](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/) (included in [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/) or as an individual plugin) in this 6-part training series.

04 - It's time to composite your shot! Match your foreground and background elements together with color matching, paying close attention to edges and edge color, and the concept of a light wrap.
