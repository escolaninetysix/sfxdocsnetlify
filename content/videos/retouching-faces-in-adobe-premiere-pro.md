We'll never forget when we first saw **Sunset Boulevard** and heard that iconic line, "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up." Filmmaking has changed a lot since then but a major constant is the need to have talent look and feel her or his best. Luckily, [Continuum's](/products/continuum/) Beauty Studio with built-in Mocha tracking & masking is here to take the pain out of digital make-up and beauty work.

Beauty Studio is included in the full [Continuum Suite](/products/continuum/) or can be purchased as part of the [Image Restoration Unit](/products/continuum-units/image-restoration/).

In this [Continuum tutorial](/products/continuum/), Premiere Gal shows how to retouch and smooth skin in Adobe Premiere Pro with Beauty Studio.
