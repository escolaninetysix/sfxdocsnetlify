Fix poorly lit green screens with the plug-ins found in Boris Continuum
Complete. In this tutorial, Vin Morreale shows how he salvaged a green screen
shot with a combination of Chroma Key Studio, Fast Film Process, Title Studio
and Grunge - all inside of Avid Media Composer.

BCC Chroma Key Studio is an all-in-one keying plug-in. It combines screen
enhancement, auto-garbage matte and masking, chroma key, matte cleanup, matte
choker, foreground color correction and light wrap into a single filter.
