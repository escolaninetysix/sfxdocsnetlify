A Sony Vegas Pro editor recently inquired regarding how to create a crop centered on a person moving around in a scene - to achieve a pan and zoom effect with the pan linked to a tracker. Boris FX Senior Product Manager Dirk de Jong demonstrates how to achieve this effect using [ Boris RED ](/products/red/)'s Motion Stabilizer feature.
