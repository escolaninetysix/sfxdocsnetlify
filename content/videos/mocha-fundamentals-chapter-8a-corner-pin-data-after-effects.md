What you'll learn:

  * Check your track with your own clips
  * The different types of Corner Pin data
  * Using different size footage in After Effects

There are a number of different ways to use corner pin data out of **Mocha**
and in After Effects. In this exercise we look at three of them; raw corner
pin data, corner pin data with motion blur and corner pin data offset with
Align Surface. The techniques shown here solve the most common problems people
face bringing corner pin data in. We see how to deal with footage that is a
different size or aspect ratio than our main composition. Plus how to use the
Align Surface technique, which is useful for rig removal and background clean-
up.
