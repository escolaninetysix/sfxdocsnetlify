In this tutorial, you'll learn about creating 3D motion from a non-perspective
track in **Mocha**. We'll be using MochaBlend C4D's 2.5D solver to create the
3D motion. You'll learn how to analyze the motion in your shot so you can both
track it properly in **Mocha**, and choose the correct solver in MochaBlend
C4D.
