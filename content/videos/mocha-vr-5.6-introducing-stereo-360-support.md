**Mocha VR 5.6** now supports stereoscopic 3D footage for 360° post-production. 

Use **Mocha's** famous planar tracking tools to "track both eyes" and quickly solve 3D disparity - huge time savings on tracking, masking, nadir patching and more.  

**Mocha VR** is designed for common mono & stereo 360°  tasks: horizon stabilization, removing the camera at nadir, inserting tracked graphics that follow objects and general spherical tracking and masking tasks.  

Available as a standalone application or plug-in for Adobe After Effects & Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer and OFX Hosts: Nuke, Fusion, Vegas Pro & HitFilm Pro.
