Take a tour of three of the five filters that make up the [Continuum VR Unit](/products/continuum-units/continuum-vr/ "Continuum VR Unit").

**1) VR Sharpen**  
This filter provides the highest quality 360 video sharpening available in a plugin. It uses state-of-the-art image algorithms to enhance image detail while minimizing artifacts associated with traditional sharpening tools.

**2) VR Flicker Fixer**  
Continuum VR Flicker Fixer can eliminate or reduce luminance flicker with one simple click, providing 3 different methods for removing flicker.

**3) VR Blur**  
The Blur filter generates out-of-focus effects by emulating the look of shooting with soft focus or a lens diffusion filter. Designed from the ground up to operate in 360/VR with multiple edge wrap modes to process pixels that reside along the edge of the 360 seam.
