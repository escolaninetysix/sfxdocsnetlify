Unwarping and Rewarping work is a big part of dealing with Lens Distorted footage, especially when you need to composite visual effects, set replacements, or screen inserts. 

Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you through a Quick Tip on non-destructive Lens Distortion workflow from Mocha Pro into NUKE using STMaps. 

The Mocha Pro OFX plugin can be launched from NUKE or use the standalone Mocha Pro application on macOS, Windows and Linux.
