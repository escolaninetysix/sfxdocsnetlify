What you'll learn: • Tracking multiple objects • The importance of track
mattes • Figuring our tracking order When tracking objects, they will often
get obscured by other things in the scene. We look at how we deal with
tracking an object that disappears behind other shapes. We go into detail
about the importance of track mattes and what order we track the shapes.
