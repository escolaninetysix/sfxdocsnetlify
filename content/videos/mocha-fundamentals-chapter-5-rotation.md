What you'll learn: • Problems when tracking rotation • How big to make your
shapes • Fixing troublesome tracks in AdjustTrack Tracking rotation in an
object can be tough, even with **Mocha's** planar tracker. It is made even
trickier when tracking motion blur. This exercise discusses different
techniques for getting the best track possible. When a solid track is not
possible, we move to the AdjustTrack module to fix our data for the perfect
match.
