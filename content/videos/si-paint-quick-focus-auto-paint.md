The engine that drives [Silhouette Paint](https://borisfx.com/products/silhouette-paint/) is called Auto Paint. Itâ€™s a unique hybrid paint system that gives you the speed of raster paint with the flexibility and repeatability of vector paint. Paint on one frame and easily repeat those strokes across your entire clip.

Silhouette Paint is available as a plugin for Adobe and OFX or as part of the standalone Silhouette application.
