New! [Boris FX Sapphire 2020](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/)

Love the dreamy romantic look of lens whacking but afraid to potentially ruin your camera? You no longer have to shoot using a lens detached from your camera body to create the popular technique.

The new S_FreeLens effect combines light leaks, lens distortion, tilt-shift, and a moving focal point. Quickly tweak any effect setting using the easy-to-use master lens manipulation parameters.
