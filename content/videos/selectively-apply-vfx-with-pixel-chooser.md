An Avid editor recently inquired regarding how to change the color of a white painted door in a scene while retaining all of the door's detail. Boris FX Senior Product Manager Dirk de Jong responded to the question with this screencap that illustrates how to accomplish this effect using [ Boris Continuum Complete AVX ](/products/continuum-complete/?host=avidHost)'s [ Colorize filter ](/products/continuum-units/stylize/) and built-in Pixel Chooser tool.
