What you'll learn:

  * Export tracking data to After Effects
  * Easily offset tracking data
  * Take tracking data directly into Boris Continuum Complete filters

This tutorial shows how to take the tracked footage in **Mocha** and use that
data in After Effects. We start with a simple match move. Then see how to get
more flexibility through the smart use of Null objects and parenting. Finally
we look at importing the same data directly into a Boris Continuum Complete
lens flare plug-in.
