Join Nick Harauz of clipsandhandles.com as he takes an introductory look at
the Sapphire Vignette effect in Adobe Premiere Pro. Vignette darkens, blurs,
or adds color to the borders of your footage. Nick will guide you through the
parameters of Vignette and demonstrate how to use this effect to enhance the
style and mood of your footage, as well as take a look at how to use
Sapphireâ€™s Grunge to create a textured vignette. Be sure to visit genarts.com
to learn more about Sapphire plug-ins for Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After
Effects, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke
by The Foundry, and many more!
