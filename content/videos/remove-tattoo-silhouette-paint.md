Remove tattoos and unwanted objects from moving video. In this in-depth tutorial, Boris FX Senior Product Specialist, Mary Poplin, walks you through a paint out of a large shoulder tattoo. 

[Silhouette Paint](https://borisfx.com/products/silhouette-paint/) is a plugin for After Effects, Premiere Pro, Nuke, Flame, Resolve, Fusion, and Vegas Pro. Techniques used are motion-tracked paint with integrated Mocha planar tracking, the blemish tool, and frequency separation paint using the color and detail.
