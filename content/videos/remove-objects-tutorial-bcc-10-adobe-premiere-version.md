Available for Adobe Premiere Pro & After Effects - Continuum has tools for image restoration such as removing unwanted objects.

In this slow paced tutorial, Mary Poplin shows you how to use the Continuum Remover plug-in to clone out an unwanted sign and the integrated Mocha masking tools to roto-mask the foreground back on top.

Mocha planar tracking and masking tools are integrated into the Continuum PixelChooser and found inside almost every Continuum effect.
