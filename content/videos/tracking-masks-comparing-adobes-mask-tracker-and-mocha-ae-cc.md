Adobe's Create Cloud has a powerful tool called "Mask Tracker" that is used to
animated masks with minimal effort. The Mask tracker is found in both Premiere
Pro CC 2014 and After Effects CC 2014. Also included in After Effects CC 2014
is **Mocha AE CC**, a dedicated planar tracking and masking tool that is
similar to the Mask Tracker, but adds extra functionality for keyframe
control, linking tracks to masks and many advanced methods for overcoming the
most difficult masking challenges with **planar tracking**. In this feature
comparison video, Imagineer Systems product specialist, Mary Poplin, covers
some similarities and differences between the Mask Tracker effect and the
bundled free **Mocha AE CC**. Understanding when to turn to either tool will
help users create visual effects with accuracy and time savings. Footage
