Join John Dickinson of Motionworks.net as he takes an introductory look at the
Sapphire Vignette effect in Adobe After Effects. Vignette darkens, blurs, or
adds color to the borders of your footage. John will guide you through the
parameters of Vignette and demonstrate how to use this effect to enhance the
style and mood of your footage. Be sure to visit genarts.com to learn more
about Sapphire plug-ins for Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid
Media Composer, Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke by The
Foundry, and many more!
