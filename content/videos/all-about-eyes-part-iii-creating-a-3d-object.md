In the third and final installment of All About Eyes, you'll take everything
you learned in Part I: Iris Texture and Part II: Iris Dilation and map it to a
3D model.

Armed with [ BCC 3D Objects ](/products/continuum-units/3d-objects/) and [ BCC Layer Deformer ](/products/continuum-units/3d-objects/) in Adobe After Effects, Boris FX's Paul Ezzy
shows you how to create a realistic 3D eyeball, complete with 3D lighting and
cameras. Next you'll discover how to dilate your iris in response to AE
lights. And finally, you'll make your AE lights cast visible volumetric light
with [ BCC Stage Light ](/products/continuum-units/lights/) (new to [ BCC ](/products/continuum/) ). The end result? An eerily atmospheric 3D eye
that's fully integrated with AE lights &amp; camera! [ Download Project
