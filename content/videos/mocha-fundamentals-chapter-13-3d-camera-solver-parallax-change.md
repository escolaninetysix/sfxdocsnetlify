What you'll learn:

  * Tracking motion cameras
  * What tracking shapes work
  * How the Camera Solver works

This tutorial is about how to pick the right type of shapes to track for
**Mocha** to generate a 3D camera solve of a moving camera. The amount, size
and placement of the track layers are crucial to getting good data. We look at
how we improve the initial solve to add further tracked features and
demonstrate how **Mocha's** Camera Solver differs from a regular 3D
matchmaker.
