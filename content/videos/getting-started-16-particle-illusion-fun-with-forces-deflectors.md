It's time to have fun with [Particle Illusion's](https://borisfx.com/products/particle-illusion/ "Boris FX Particle Illusion") forces and deflectors. Ben Brownlee shows how to create natural, organic-looking animations quickly without 100s of keyframes. 

Starting with deflectors, create a fast effect of water flowing downhill, followed by creating deflectors around text that let our particles bounce off in interesting directions. See how to create push and churn effects and how to start simulating turbulence using grid forces. You'll also see an advanced technique of how to keep complete control of particle speed during the simulation.
