Create an information middle third to add to the finished 3D animation. Use [Title Studio](https://borisfx.com/products/title-studio/ "Boris FX Title Studio") to create a mixture of graphical and text elements with a little help from Adobe Photoshop to create a fast flag waving effect. 

Learn how to work with 2D text effects including a more complex text type on effect.

Finally, use this project in other hots that support Continuum effects, eg, Avid, Premiere Pro, and Resolve.
