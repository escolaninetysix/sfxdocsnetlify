In this webinar, 360° editors will see the power and speed of the [Continuum VR Unit](/products/continuum-units/continuum-vr/).

This event was presented inside Adobe Premiere Pro CC and After Effects CC. However, the Continuum VR Unit techniques you’ll see can be used across all available host applications.

**Topics**

* Get a basic understanding of the tools available in Premiere and After Effects for 360° mono and stereo workflows
