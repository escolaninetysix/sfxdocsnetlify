Morphing has been traditionally used to transform one object or person into another and more recently to seamlessly transform a live-action element into a CG (computer-generated) object and vice versa.

Easily time unique shape-to-shape morphing transitions per layer with interactive previews for fast flexibility â€” as seen on some of the world's most famous music videos and effects shots.

Features:

* Distort and morph images and sequences
* Shape based morphing
* Transformations on a layer by layer basis
* Depth and folding control
* Integrated motion tracking
* Interactive preview
