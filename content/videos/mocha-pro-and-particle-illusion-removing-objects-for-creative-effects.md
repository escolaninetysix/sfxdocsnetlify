Easily create an eery ghost effect using the combined power of [Mocha Pro](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/ "Boris FX Mocha Pro"), [Particle Illusion](https://borisfx.com/products/particle-illusion/ "Boris FX Particle Illusion"), and [Sapphire](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/ "Boris FX Sapphire").

Mary Poplin shows you how to use Mocha Pro to remove an actress from the foreground to link to a clean plate created in Photoshop. Next you'll add wispy, smoke elements using Particle Illusion. And you'll finish it up with Sapphire's glow effects to help create the overall transparent ghost-like look.
