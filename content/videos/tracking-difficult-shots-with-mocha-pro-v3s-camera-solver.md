In this tutorial, Mary Poplin shows you how to planar track a difficult whip-
pan in a shot and drop 3D models into a composite in both After Effects and
Cinema 4D. The process covers: • Tracking long shots • Tracking shots where
you don't have good planar information for the entire length of the shot •
Avoiding Reflections, Shadows, and other hiccups for the planar tracker •
Using the 3D camera solver and it's settings • Exporting 3D cameras to After
Effects and Cinema 4D • Setting up your shot in After Effects and Cinema 4D
