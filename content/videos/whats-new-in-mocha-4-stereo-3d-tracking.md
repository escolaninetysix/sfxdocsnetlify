A quick look at what is new inside **Mocha Pro** version 4.

A major change to **Mocha's** workflow is being able to choose between working
on mono or stereo projects. You can now import stereo views and track, roto
and render, then export back to stereo.

**Mocha Pro 4** has been updated to support native stereo 3D. This new workflow uses planar tracking analysis on “both views” to reduce manual offsets and tedious keyframe work on stereo 3D roto, tracking and object removal.

**Mocha Pro 4** exports Stereo 3D roto and tracking exports for NUKE and Adobe After Effects. Stereo 3D Camera FBX exports to Nuke, Maya and more.
