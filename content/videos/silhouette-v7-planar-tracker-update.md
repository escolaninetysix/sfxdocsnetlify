Silhouette v7 updated the native planar tracking to be more robust and accurate. Use planar tracking to drive masking and paint with even fewer keyframes OR choose the optional Mocha planar tracking option. 

Silhouetteâ€™s Planar Tracker tracks several points (corners, edges and ridges) on the image while automatically handling partial occlusions of the tracked object, producing excellent results even with textureless objects. The Mocha Planar Tracker option provides 2D transformation data by tracking planes rather than points.

Silhouette is now a Boris FX product.
