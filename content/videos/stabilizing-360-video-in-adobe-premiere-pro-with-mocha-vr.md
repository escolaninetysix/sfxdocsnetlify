When shooting 360 video, moving the camera often introduces jittery motion and stabilization issues. If not corrected, these videos can cause nausea inducing viewing experiences and negative reactions to immersive video.

Mocha VR plug-in for Adobe users is a simple solution for 360 stabilization and can be run directly inside Adobe Premiere Pro & After Effects. This video will focus on "stabilizing the horizon" with Mocha VR and Premiere Pro.
