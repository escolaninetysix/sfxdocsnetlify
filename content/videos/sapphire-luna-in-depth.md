Join <a href="http://Motionworks.net" target="_blank">John Dickinson of Motionworks.net</a> with this in depth tutorial on Luna, an all new effect in Sapphire 10. Luna creates a photo-realistic rendering of the moon that features accurate lunar cycles down to date and time. 

This tutorial shows how to further hone the look of luna by tweaking parameter such as glow, atmosphere, color correction, bumpiness, and moonlight halos.
