In this tutorial, Mary Poplin will walk you through a quick lens calibration
to undistort footage, and how to render distortion maps out of Mocha Pro into
Nuke. Mocha Pro v3.1 can now export lens data into any compositing program
that reads rasterized ST maps, including Nuke, Fusion, and Flame. Mocha AE
v3.1 now adds the lens module, previously available in Mocha Pro and a Mocha
Lens plug-in to import distortion data into After Effects.
