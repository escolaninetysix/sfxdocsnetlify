The "Roto-Mask" plug-in for Final Cut Pro X SliceX lets you create instant
Shape Masks to cut out layers or isolate effects directly in Final Cut Pro X
without having to go into Motion or create the masks with an external program.
Create animated garbage mattes, blur shapes and more directly within your
Final Cut timeline NEW! Slice X is now powered by Mocha's Academy Award
winning planar tracking engine to easily track roto masks for accurate masking
with less manual keyframing.
