Ben Brownlee, Director of Production & Learning, shows DaVinci Resolve users how to pull a perfect key using [Continuum's Primatte Studio](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/) (included in [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/) or as an individual plugin) in this 6-part training series.

06 - Finish off your seamless compositing with color grading using Resolve's own tools, plus other Continuum plugins for a holistic touch. You'll also take another look at edge details and push the limits of what you can do with a single instance of a keyer filter.
