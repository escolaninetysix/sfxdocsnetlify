Join Nick Harauz of clipsandhandles.com as he takes an introductory look at
Sapphireâ€™s Lens Flare effect in Adobe Premiere Pro. LensFlare re-creates
highly customizable lighting elements on your footage. Also included it a
breakdown of the LenFlare Designer, an easy to use application that allows you
to break down your flare into individual editable elements. Nick will guide
you through the parameters of LensFlare and demonstrate the workflow he uses
when integrating custom flares into his footage. Be sure to visit genarts.com
to learn more about Sapphire plug-ins for Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After
Effects, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Autodesk Flame, Nuke
by The Foundry, and many more!
