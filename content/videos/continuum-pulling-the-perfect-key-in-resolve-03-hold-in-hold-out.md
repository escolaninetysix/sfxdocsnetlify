Ben Brownlee, Director of Production & Learning, shows DaVinci Resolve users how to pull a perfect key using [Continuum's Primatte Studio](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/) (included in [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/) or as an individual plugin) in this 6-part training series.

03 - What do you do when a chromakey can't do it all? Learn how to use  Primatte Studio's built-in Mocha planar tracker to create simple garbage masks to hold-out areas you don't want. Plus how to create more complex roto shapes to hold-in areas that are getting keyed out. Perfect for reflections or colors that are close to the color of the green screen.
