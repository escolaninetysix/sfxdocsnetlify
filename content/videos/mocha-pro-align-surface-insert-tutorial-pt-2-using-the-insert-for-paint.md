In this in-depth sequel to a recent insert tutorial, Boris FX product specialist, Mary Poplin, shows you that align surface and the insert tool are for more than screens and logo replacements. Any time you create a clean plate in context from a still frame in your shot, you can use the Align Surface tool to make sure your insert can be tracked and patched into the shot correctly. This means you can use the insert module for all kinds of shots, including matte paintings.

The Align Surface workflow works with any version of Mocha including the Adobe After Effects bundled Mocha AE CC, however the Insert Module with advanced features like motion blur and mesh warp compositing are only found in [Mocha Pro](/products/mocha-pro/).
