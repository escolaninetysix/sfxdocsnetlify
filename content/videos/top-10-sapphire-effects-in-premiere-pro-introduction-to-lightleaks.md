Join Nick Harauz of clipsandhandles.com as he takes an introductory look at
the Sapphire LightLeak effect in Adobe Premiere Pro. LightLeak is a classic
look that beautifully simulates what happens when light leaks into the lens
due to a camera error. Nick will guide you through the parameters of LightLeak
and how to add texture and color to your footage, and how to use the Sapphire
Transition Builder to create a custom LightLeak transition. Be sure to visit
genarts.com to learn more about Sapphire plug-ins for Adobe Premiere Pro,
Adobe After Effects, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Autodesk
Flame, Nuke by The Foundry, and many more!
