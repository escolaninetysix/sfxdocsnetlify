Toronto-based Avid editor and Creative Cow leader, Kevin P. McAuliffe, demonstrates the finer techniques of Avid FX 6 in Avid Media Composer. In just one hour, you'll discover how to convert bitmaps to vector (extremely handy when a client gives you a jpeg!), clone with the paint tool and [ BCC Optical Stabilizer ](/products/continuum-units/image-restoration/) , create write-on effects, and import an EPS file and extrude it into a 3D object that's also animated in 3D space.
