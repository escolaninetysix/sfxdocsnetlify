In this advanced Mocha tutorial, Mary Poplin, shows how to create a seamless
take combination from two hand held shots. Covers Mocha planar tracking,
stabilization, insert module and workflow.

This technique can be used to make one actor into a set of twins (ex: Legend
and The Parent Trap), to retime and combine performances (used in movies such
as Bridesmaids and The Hangover) or to create the illusion of one long,
continuous take (seen in films Gone Girl and Bird Man).

This tutorial assumes that you know the basics of Mocha tracking and masking.

This tutorial covers three different Mocha techniques: simple Mocha Pro
standalone compositing, Nuke compositing and Adobe After Effects compositing -
with the bundled Mocha for AE.
