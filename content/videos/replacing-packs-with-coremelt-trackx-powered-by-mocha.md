**TrackX powered by Mocha** is a powerful plug-in tool to enable FCP X editors to easily track and insert graphics and layers. Just draw a shape around the object you want to track and the Academy Award winning Mocha tracking engine will lock on and allow you to track text, do screen replacements, replace signs and more. This tutorial shows you how to replace a pack in a shot by tracking in new artwork using **TrackX powered by Mocha**. You might want to do this to avoid showing a brand logo or to make the logo and artwork more clear. [Get more info](http://www.imagineersystems.com/products/partner-products/slicex-track-x/)
