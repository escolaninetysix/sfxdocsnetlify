New! [Boris FX Sapphire 2020](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/ "Boris FX Sapphire")

Long-requested OpenColorIO (OCIO) support is here! View all Sapphire effects in the proper color pipeline. You can apply and read OCIO color profiles inside all applications: the Preset Browser, Flare Designer, and Effect & Transition Builder. 

If your host hasn't already implemented the OCIO standard, use the new S_OCIOTransform effect that allows Sapphire to bring OCIO color management to any of its supported hosts.
