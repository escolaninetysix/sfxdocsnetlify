This new Mocha Pro tutorial shows how to reverse stabilize a warped surface to remove and fix objects. 

Mocha product manager, Martin Brennand uses PowerMesh tracking to create a "stabilized and warped plate" with Mocha Pro's Stabilize Module. This new image is then composited with Mocha Pro's Insert Module to patch and fix a rip in the pants.

The tutorial is created using Mocha Pro inside Adobe After Effects, but the subject is applicable for other supported VFX hosts such as Nuke, Flame, and Fusion.
