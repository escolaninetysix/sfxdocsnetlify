A deeper look at Brush, an all new effect in Sapphire 10. Sapphire’s Brush
transforms your video footage into a stylish hand-painted work of art by
offering a variety of stroke techniques including watercolors, oil paints,
pencil sketching, and even paper collages. The stroke techniques can be
further customized with parameters such as size, color, density, roughness,
and deterioration.
