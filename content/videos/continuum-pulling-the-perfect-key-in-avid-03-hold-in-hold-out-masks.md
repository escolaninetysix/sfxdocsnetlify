What do you do when a chromakey can't do it all? You use **Continuum Primatte Studio's** built-in Mocha planar tracking! Learn how to create simple garbage masks using Mocha to hold-out areas you don't want, then create more complex roto shapes to hold-in areas that are getting keyed out.  (Part 3 of 6)
