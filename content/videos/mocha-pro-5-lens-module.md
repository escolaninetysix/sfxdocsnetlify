Mocha Pro's Lens Module was designed to calibrate distortion introduced by
camera lenses.

Unwanted lens distortion can be removed or matched for realistic compositing.
Export to the free Mocha Lens plug-in for After Effects or export distortion
map data for Nuke, Flame, Fusion and more*.

New in Mocha Pro 5 is the plug-in option for Adobe, Avid and coming soon OFX.
