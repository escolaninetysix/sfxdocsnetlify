Mocha Pro 5 now includes a Python scripting module with in-application
interface. Python lets artists and technical directors control the user
interface, modify and edit functions, and integrate with external applications
and asset management systems.

Python is a widely used scripting language that is completely integrated into
the **Mocha Pro 5** standalone option. This video shows a couple examples of
custom tools built in Python, such as BG rendering or custom exporters.

_Note: the Python module is currently not available in the Mocha Pro 5 plug-in
option, only the standalone application._
