This replay of a live Mocha Pro webinar features professional VFX artist and roto/paint supervisor, Clark Harding.   

Along with Boris FX product specialist Mary Poplin, Clark takes an in-depth look at the [Mocha for NUKE](/products/mocha-pro/) workflow that he used on tent-pole Hollywood films such as _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_ and _Dr. Strange_.  

Learn how to apply the Mocha Pro plug-in inside of NUKE, rotoscope twice as fast as tedious hand techniques by making Mocha do your hard work for you, and apply rotopaint for flawless beauty work.  

Topics covered:  

* Tracking and Roto in Mocha Pro 
* How to Apply Shapes and Tracking Data into your NUKE Composition 
* Basic and Advanced Roto Techniques 
* Applying Rotopaint using the Mocha Pro Plug-in  

While this webinar focused on NUKE workflows, many of the techniques covered are useful for all [Mocha](/products/mocha-pro/), [Continuum](/products/continuum/) and [Sapphire](/products/sapphire/) users â€” regardless of host application.
