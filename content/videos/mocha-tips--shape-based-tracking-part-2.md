You can animate shapes using [Mocha](/products/mocha-pro/) from Boris FX.

This is the second video in a series about the surface and shape relationship.Â   
[Watch Part 1](/videos/mocha-tips-with-mary-poplin-explore-shape-based-tracking).

In this quick video, Mocha Product Specialist, Mary Poplin, explains the difference between the shape and the surface tool. Mocha's shape based planar tracking can help you solve difficult tracking challenges:

* Multiple shapes can be added to one track layer

* Shapes can be moved or animated for offset tracking

* Shape layers can be stacked to avoid foreground occulsions

[Mocha](/products/mocha-pro/) is the ideal tracking and masking plug-in for Adobe, Avid, Nuke and many more hosts.
