Chris Barrett, creator of MochaBlend C4D, illustrates what can be done by
tracking some motion in Mocha, converting it to a 3D path with MochaBlend C4D,
and linking the motion path to a polygon vertex. To complete the illusion of
the pencil tip dragging the cube corner around, an animated shadow-caster of
the hand and pencil was created from Mocha roto and projected onto the motion-
path. This technique allows you to cast real 3D shadows upon 3D geometry
(shadows on the deforming box) inside C4D.
