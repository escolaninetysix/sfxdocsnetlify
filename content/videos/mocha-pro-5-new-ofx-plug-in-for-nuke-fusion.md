New Mocha Pro 5 OFX plug-in option. Now Mocha Pro's advanced planar tracking
based tools can now be launched as a plug-in, direct from Nuke or Fusion.

No more file import/export required and your Mocha work is saved inside your
final project.

Mocha Pro 5 plug-in greatly improves on previous workflows by embedding planar
tracking and masking directly into the plug-in instead of launching a stand
alone application. This uses the OFX host media engine and project format,
reducing the need for transcoding or external file management.

Mocha Pro 5 adds advanced modules: Lens, Insert, Remove, Camera Solve &amp;
Stabilize.

More OFX host support coming soon.
