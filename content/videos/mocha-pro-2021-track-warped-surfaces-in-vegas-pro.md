In this tutorial, Boris FX product specialist Vin Morreale, shows Vegas Pro users the new features of Mocha Pro 2021. PowerMesh is a unique, sub-planar motion tracking engine that allows users to track organic and warped surfaces like clothes, skin, musculature, and more. 

Here Vin shows how to track an animated logo to an actor's moving t-shirt and match the warping motion. 

Mocha Pro is available for Vegas Pro as an OFX plugin and also available for Adobe, Avid, and other OFX hosts (Fusion, HitFilm, Nuke, Flame, and more).
