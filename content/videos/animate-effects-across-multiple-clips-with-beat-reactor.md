Watch  Kevin P. McAuliffe take an audio clip and automatically animate Boris Continuum Complete's [ Film Glow ](/products/continuum-units/film-style/) effect to music using the built-in Beat Reactor. Many [ BCC ](/products/continuum/) effects integrate Beat Reactor and this tutorial shows you how to easily create animation as well as a neat trick to ensure that the effect animates evenly across three clips from within an Avid editing system.
