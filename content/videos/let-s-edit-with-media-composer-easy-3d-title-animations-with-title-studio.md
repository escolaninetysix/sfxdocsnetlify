In this episode of Let's Edit with Media Composer, Kevin P. McAuliffe shows you just how quickly you can create a 3D animated title in a 3D environment using Continuum's Title Studio as a stand-alone application. Covers extruded text, adding lights, and more. Inspired by "The Lego Batman Movie." Plus, see the smooth workflow from stand-alone to the plug-in version of Title Studio inside Media Composer.
