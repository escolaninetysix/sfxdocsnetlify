Ben Brownlee breaks down how to create a soundwave blast effect using the [Boris FX Suite](https://borisfx.com/products/bfxsuite/?collection=boris-fx-suite&product=boris-fx-suite "Boris FX Suite") inside Adobe After Effects. (Part 4 of 4)

Learn how to finish the effect by creating air disturbance with [Sapphire](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/?collection=sapphire&product=sapphire "Sapphire | Boris FX") and [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/?collection=continuum&product=continuum "Continuum | Boris FX") plugins. Plus, Ben shows how to auto-animate using After Effect expressions (no keyframing!) including Linear and Ease. Finally, you'll balance the effects to create the finished result.
