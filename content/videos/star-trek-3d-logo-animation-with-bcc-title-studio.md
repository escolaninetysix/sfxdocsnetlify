In this video tutorial, Vin Morreale creates a Star Trek inspired animation
using BCC Title Studio to extrude and animate an EPS logo in 3D space. Title
Studio is next gen 2D/3D titling and animation plug-in that is bundled with
Boris Continuum Complete 10. The tutorial also covers BCC 3D Lens Flare for
quick and realistic flare and lighting effects.

Title Studio is the ideal titling tool for Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro
&amp; After Effects, DaVinci Resolve and more hosts.
