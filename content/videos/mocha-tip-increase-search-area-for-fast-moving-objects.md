**Quick tips to improve your motion tracking in under 2 mins!** 

Have you ever seen Mocha's planar tracker slip, jump or give errors when tracking fast-moving objects? Pro Tip: increase the search area parameter in the Track tab!  

This useful tip is relevant for [Mocha Pro](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/), Mocha AE, and the Mocha tools that are included in Boris FX [Continuum ](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/)and [Sapphire](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/). 

**Mocha Error message:** “One or more layers were not tracked properly”.

**Solution**: Increase the search area parameter in track module and track again.
