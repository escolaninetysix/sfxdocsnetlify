Planar Motion Tracking and Screen Insert Tutorial for Adobe Premiere Pro editors.

Replacing monitors and cell phones is made easy with Mocha! Mary Poplin shows how complex motion tracking and compositing is made simple with the Mocha Pro Premiere plug-in for Adobe. Mocha Pro can track through difficult motion, such as objects that go offscreen.

Premiere video tracks can be set as insert layer and rendered with motion blur for a realist effects composite inside of your edit.

Mocha Pro 5 includes new plug-in options for Adobe Premiere Pro, allowing users to do more advanced effects shots directly on their timeline.
