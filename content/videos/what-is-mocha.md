A brief overview and explanation of the Planar Tracking technology that drives
**Mocha** software from Imagineer Systems. **Mocha** is award winning tracking
software built upon a renowned Planar Tracking image engine. Mocha follows
“pixel patterns” through the most difficult conditions including objects that
go off-screen, objects that are partially obscured, even out of focus footage.
This technology drives our products and is licensed to technology partners.
Mocha’s innovation has been to create a new paradigm for motion tracking that
is faster and easier to learn than camera tracking and more robust and
dependable than point tracking. Mocha compliments post-production software
including tools from Adobe, Autodesk and Apple. To learn Mocha, go to the
