Mocha's powerful planar tracking engine is driven by shapes. In this excellent training video, Dan Harvey goes in-depth into Mocha's shape tools for editing roto-masks, tracking obscured objects, layer order and more. Mastering Mocha shapes will save time on vfx & finishing tasks. Video relevant for Adobe, Avid & OFX workflows.

Mocha projects can also be saved and shared across host platforms. Dan has created a library of common shapes that can be downloaded here: To use in Mocha Pro 5, go to file>merge project.
