UK-based trainer Dan Harvey shows Continuum 10 and Avid Media Composer users how to create highly-stylized, multi-layered broadcast graphics using the power of Title Studio. Dan adds titles, logos (.eps & tiff), animations, and more in just 10 minutes.

The techniques used can be applied to any supported Continuum host.
