Paul Ezzy is back with a follow-up to his [ BCC Laser Beam ](/products/continuum-units/lights/) Write-On Effect:
Basics.

In this advanced tutorial, Paul dives into the full capability of [ BCC ](/products/continuum/) Laser Beam in Adobe After Effects CC. Use target layers, track mattes, spotlights, and camera animation, while creating realism with flicker, smoke, sparks, and a glowing hot trail.

Plus, use [ BCC Grunge ](/products/continuum-units/stylize/) as both a background and texture effect, and learn where you can save your custom images.

Filters used: [ BCC Film Glow ](/products/continuum-units/film-style/) , [ BCC Grunge ](/products/continuum-units/stylize/) , [ BCC Laser Beam ](/products/continuum-units/lights/) , and [ BCC Particle Emitter 3D ](/products/continuum-units/particles/) .

Featured Units: Film Style, Stylize, Lights, Particles
