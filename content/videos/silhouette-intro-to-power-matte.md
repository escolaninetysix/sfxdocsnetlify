Power Matte is an easy to use interactive image matting tool that iteratively estimates the transparency value for every pixel in the image, based on a small sample of foreground (what you want to cut out) and background (what you want to get rid of) pixels marked by defining simple shapes on the image. 

Results show that compared with previous approaches, our method is more efficient and requires minimal effort to extract high-quality mattes for foregrounds with significant semi-transparent regions. In addition, the foreground edge colors can be estimated in the semi-transparent areas to create a seamless composite.
