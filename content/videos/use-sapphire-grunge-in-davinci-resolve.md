Join Nick Harauz, Resolve certified instructor and trainer, with this in depth tutorial on Sapphire's Grunge effect in [Davinci Resolve](/products/sapphire-for-davinci-resolve/). Grunge combines multiple stamp collections of stains, cracks, and other elements to create a texture overlay on your footage. Nick breaks down this effect parameter by parameter and shows how to create a naturalistic grunge overlay with shaking and blinking auto-animation.
