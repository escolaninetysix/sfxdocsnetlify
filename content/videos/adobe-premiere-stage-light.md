The [Continuum Stage Light filter](/products/continuum-filters/stage-light/) creates beautiful volumetric lighting using multiple integrated spotlights or point light sources right within Adobe Premiere Pro CC.  Navigate around the visible scene lighting using the built-in 3D camera system and use the integrated smoke / fog generator for added realism.
