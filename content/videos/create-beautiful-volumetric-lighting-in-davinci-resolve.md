Use Sapphire EdgeRays to create photorealistic lighting effects. This quick Blackmagic Davinci Resolve tutorial covers how to use Sapphire EdgeRays to:

* adjust rays length,
* produce rays under source,
* bring down ray quality, and
* apply shimmer.

[Sapphire EdgeRays](/effects/sapphire-edgerays/) is a filter included in the [VFX plugin Sapphire](/products/sapphire/) from Boris FX.
