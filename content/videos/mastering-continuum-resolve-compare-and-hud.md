[Continuum’s](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/) Compare and HUD modes make it easy to apply tweaks to your effect depending on your preferred visual workflow. Compare mode gives you multiple before-and-after options including side-by-side comparison as you work. The HUD allows you to tweak your effect parameters using your own custom viewer. There’s something for every DaVinci Resolve user!
