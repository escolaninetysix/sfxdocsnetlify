<a href="https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/?collection=mocha-pro&product=mocha-pro" target="_blank">Mocha Pro's</a> popular Lens Module gets an update in the 2022.5 release. Remove unwanted lens distortion or match it more easily thanks to a faster new process featuring spline-based calibration and the ability to save calibration settings to use on similar shots.

Lens Calibration data can be rendered in the Adobe After Effects plugin and can also be exported and read into Nukeâ€™s STMap node or other VFX applications.
