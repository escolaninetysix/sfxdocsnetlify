Ben Brownlee, Director of Production & Learning, shows DaVinci Resolve users how to pull a perfect key using [Continuum's Primatte Studio ](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/ "Boris FX Continuum Primatte Studio plugin")(included in [Continuum](https://wpiquvk0zdc7fw.instant.forestry.io/products/continuum/ "Boris FX Continuum") or as an individual plugin) in this 6-part training series.

01 - Learn how to create a primary key using less than perfect green screen footage. You'll analyze the footage to identify any potential problems and quickly create an initial alpha channel with Auto Analysis and Primatte Studio's cleanup tools. At the end of this video, you'll be able to get a great first result. Maintain fine hair details without refining the matte too much.
