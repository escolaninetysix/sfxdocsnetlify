In this advanced VFX video tutorial, Mary Poplin reviews the steps she used to remove multiple objects from a moving shot with the Mocha Pro plug-in from Boris FX. Covers advanced tips for planar tracking and object removal.

Tips:   
Combining multiple mask layers for speed.  
Consider geometry and planes - when objects pass various planes, you will need multiple tracked background surfaces for best remove results.   
Consider how the background is moving and isolate areas that move differently than one another for best results.

The [Mocha Pro](/products/mocha-pro) plug-in supports Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, NUKE, Fusion, HitFilm, Vegas Pro and more.
