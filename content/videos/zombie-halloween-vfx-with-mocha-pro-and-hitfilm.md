Create digital makeup effects that stick to the skin with PowerMesh tracking! In this tutorial, Mocha product manager, Martin Brennand uses the Mocha Pro OFX plug-in running inside HitFilm Pro, but this technique will also work inside all other supported applications including After Effects, Premiere Pro, and other OFX hosts.

PowerMesh is Mocha Pro's flexible sub-planar motion tracking that allows you to capture organic motion. Learn how to create the effect of creeping zombification and create your own Halloween horror transformations.
