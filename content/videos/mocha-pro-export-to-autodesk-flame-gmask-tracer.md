**Mocha Pro 2020.5** adds a new export format to better support Autodesk Flame artists. Mocha Pro can export directly to Gmask Tracer nodes with separated axis transformations for more control. 

In this short tutorial, VFX artist Dan Harvey shows how to create and export planar tracked X-splines and Bezier splines to the Gmask Tracer format to composite in Flame. 

Boris FX Mocha Pro is available as a standalone application and plug-in for Adobe, Avid and OFX. For Autodesk Flame, the Mocha Pro OFX plug-in can be run from within Flame on macOS and Linux, enabling a complementary workflow for tracking and masking.
