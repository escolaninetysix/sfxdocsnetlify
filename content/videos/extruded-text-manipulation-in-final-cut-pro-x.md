Senior Product Manager Dirk de Jong demonstrates how to use [ Boris Continuum
Complete ](/products/continuum/)
's [ Extruded Text ](/products/continuum-units/3d-objects/) within Apple Final Cut Pro X to generate true 3D text over an image.
See how easy it is to adjust the text size, spacing attributes, lighting,
surfaces, and the blend mode to composite the 3D text into the background
image. Stack up other [ Boris Continuum Complete
](/products/continuum/) filters
and quickly create striking 3D text for titles or text-based effects.
