Learn how to use the Continuum 11 VR Unit inside Blackmagic Davinci Resolve 14. 

Resolve 14 is a very powerful tool with resolve effects, color tools, and finishing tools. Because it does not natively support immersive 360 degree video though, it can break the seam and the immersion when using a lot of the native effects. 

The Boris FX VR Unit gives you additional control when working with finishing and color when working with 360 immersive video inside Resolve.

The [Continuum VR Unit](/products/continuum-units/continuum-vr/) filters are: VR Reorient, VR Insert, VR Blur, VR Sharpen, and VR Flicker Fixer.
