In this one hour webinar from Boris FX, Ross Shain and Mary Poplin cover the five new 360° enabled filters included with [Continuum 11](/products/continuum/) and stereoscopic support in [Mocha VR](/products/mocha-pro/) .

As the growing immersive video space evolves, editors require robust, stereoscopic enabled tools for fixing and finishing 360 video projects. The new Continuum VR filters join Mocha VR as the most powerful complement to Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects and Avid Media Composer workflows.

Tools designed for common 360 video tasks:

-Reorienting & Inserting Graphics in mono & stereo

-Advanced Sharpening and Reducing Flicker

-Horizon Stabilization to Reduce Motion Fatigue

-Object Removal, Tracking & Masking
