With the release of Mocha v5.5.2, we now support Magix VEGAS Pro as an integrated plug-in!

The Mocha Pro OFX plug-in can be used for planar motion tracking, screen inserts, object removals, stabilization and more. This powerful workflow brings Mocha's professional visual effects and capabilities directly to the VEGAS Pro timeline.
