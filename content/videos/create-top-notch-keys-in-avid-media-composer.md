One of the most difficult effects to do inside of a nonlinear editing
 application is a [ Chroma Key ](/products/continuum-units/key-and-blend/) . The NLE's built-in keyer may not work for every shot
 and you may need extra tools to refine the matte to make it look seamless.
 With the power of [ Boris Continuum Complete ](/products/continuum/) inside of Avid's Media Composer, not only
 can you create a fantastic looking key from a poorly shot plate, but you can
\ refine it using [ Matte Choker ](/products/continuum-units/key-and-blend/) and [ Light Wrap ](/products/continuum-units/key-and-blend/), and really make it look top notch.

Filters Used Include: Chroma Key, Matte Choker, Light Wrap
