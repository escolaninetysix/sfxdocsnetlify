Insert tracked graphics into 360 video using Mocha VR working inside Adobe Premiere Pro.

This tutorial by Nick Harauz covers the basic process of using Mocha VR's planar tracking inside of Premiere to insert graphics into a shot. Includes Mocha VR's unique 360 masking workflow to integrate the graphic back into the scene.

Mocha VR is the ideal [360 video plug-in]](/products/mocha-pro/). Switch between native equirectangular and recti-linear flattened workspace to achieve advanced finishing results without precomps.

[Mocha VR](/products/mocha-pro/) supports Adobe, Avid, and OFX hosts such as Nuke, Fusion and Vegas Pro.
