A Sony Vegas Pro editor recently inquired regarding how to resize and reposition a reflection map over [ 3D extruded text ](/products/continuum-units/3d-objects/) in [ Boris RED ](/products/red/) . He also wanted to learn how to apply a blur filter to the inner portion of transparent [ 3D extruded text ](/products/continuum-units/3d-objects/) without affecting the edges of the text. Dirk De Jong responded with this screencap.
