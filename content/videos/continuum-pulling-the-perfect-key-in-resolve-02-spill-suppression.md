Ben Brownlee, Director of Production & Learning, shows DaVinci Resolve users how to pull a perfect key using [Continuum's Primatte Studio](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum-filters/primatte-studio/) (included in [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/) or as an individual plugin) in this 6-part training series.

02 - Discover the importance of great spill suppression to maintaining fine hair detail and motion blur to keep a natural result.  Primatte Studio features two distinct ways of removing green or blue spill from your footage. Learn how to use both and when to use one over another.
