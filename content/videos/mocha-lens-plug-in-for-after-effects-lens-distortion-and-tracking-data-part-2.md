In part 2 of this tutorial, Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you through
how to use corner pin tracking data with the new Mocha Lens plug-in supported
with Mocha AE v3.1 and Mocha Pro v3.1. Topics include: 1\. Exporting corner
pin data from Mocha to After Effects when Lens distortion has been removed.
2\. Warping corner pin data from Mocha in After Effects when Lens distortion
has not been removed. See part 1 for: 1\. Calibrating a lens with the Lens
Module. 2\. Exporting data to After Effects to undistort lens-warped footage.
