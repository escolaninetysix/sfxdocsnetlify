New in [Sapphire 2022](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/?collection=sapphire&product=sapphire "Sapphire | Boris FX | VFX Plugins for Adobe, Avid, OFX")! 

Sapphire's UltraZap adds built-in Mocha planar tracking and spline-based tools to the popular electrifying effect. Drive animations with tracked splines or import projects from Mocha Pro and Mocha AE. All supported hosts now have access to the advanced UltraZap features previously only available to After Effects users.
