This video is a quick start guide for using the VR Unit from Boris FX inside Avid Media Composer. The VR Unit includes five powerful filters: [VR Blur](/effects/continuum-vr-blur-1/), [VR Sharpen](/effects/continuum-vr-sharpen-1/), [VR Reorient](/effects/continuum-vr-reorient-1/), [VR Insert](/effects/continuum-vr-insert-1/) and [VR Flicker Fixer](/effects/continuum-vr-flicker-fixer-1/).

These new filters support mono & stereoscopic 360 formats such as top/bottom.
