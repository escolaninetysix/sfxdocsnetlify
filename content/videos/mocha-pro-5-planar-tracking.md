Mocha's Academy award-winning planar tracking engine accurately solves the
most difficult motion tracking challenges. Unlimited tracking layers and
advanced user interface can handle reflections, occluded and blurred objects,
even areas with low detail.

New in Mocha Pro 5, OpenCL GPU accelerated tracking gives significant speed
enhancements on supported HW.

Also new in Mocha Pro 5 is the plug-in option for Adobe, Avid and coming soon
OFX.
