Learn how to solve difficult screen inserts and replacements. Mary Poplin dives deep into Mocha's planar tracking workflow, the AdjustTrack Module, the Insert Module, and Magnetic Splines for roto.

Techniques apply to all [Mocha Pro](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/ "Boris FX Mocha Pro") plug-in hosts, Mocha AE, and the standalone application.

Mary also takes advantage of [Continuum's](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/ "Boris FX Continuum") Primatte Keyer and [Sapphire's](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/ "Boris FX Sapphire") glow and blurs to finish the composite.
