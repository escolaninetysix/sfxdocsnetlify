<p>Mega Plate is a unique new module building on Mocha’s most powerful core technologies; planar tracking and temporal frame analysis to create a stitched extended frame for visual effects tasks.</p>

<p>Working with Mega Plates is a new way to visualize and work on a larger than raster “Mega” canvas for common VFX tasks such as object removal, clean plating, sky replacements, matte painting, and set extensions.</p>

<p>A rendered Mega Plate can be saved for Mocha's Remove Module or exported with tracking data for advanced effects and clean up in Foundry NUKE, Adobe After Effects, Blackmagic Fusion or other VFX applications.</p>
