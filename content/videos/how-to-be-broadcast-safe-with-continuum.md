It's frustrating when you've nicely wrapped up your project only to find out that it was rejected by the broadcaster because it failed their broadcast safe requirements. Continuum 11's new Broadcast Safe filter helps save you time by guaranteeing your project adheres to rigorous broadcast safe color standards.Â   

Join colorist Dan Harvey for a tour of the Broadcast Safe filter in Continuum 11 from Boris FX ("BCC"), and see just how easy is it to make your footage broadcast safe.

In this video, Dan is working in AVID Media Composer (Broadcast Safe works with all Continuum 11 ("BCC") supported hosts).

Broadcast Safe is available in [Continuum 11](/products/continuum/) and the [Image Restoration Unit](/products/continuum-units/image-restoration/).
