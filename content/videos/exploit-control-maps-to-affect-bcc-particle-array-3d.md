Using [ Boris Continuum Complete ](/products/continuum-complete/) 's powerful [ Particle Array 3D ](/products/continuum-units/particles/) filter in Adobe After Effects, Boris FX Senior
Product Manager Dirk de Jong demonstrates how simple it is to affect
attributes of the array. By adding Control Maps as either a Graph or a Layer
Control or even both - the Layer Control being a reference to another After
Effects layer - the array can be manipulated and animated. Adding Control Maps
can make the array assume the shape of another layer as well as affect many
other attributes of the array.

Filters Used Include: Particle Array 3D

Featured Unit: Particles
