Need to get up-and-running quickly with Mocha? Ben Brownlee, VFX artist and master trainer (Curious Turtle), guides Mocha users through the basics of Mocha’s powerful tools.

In this tutorial we look at creating a 3D Camera Solve using Mocha Pro’s planar tracker to calculate parallax camera movement from multiple co-planar objects. We see what to look for when objects don’t remain visible for the duration of the shot.
