Imagineer Systems Product Manager Martin Brennand takes you though some of the
daily Mocha tips we've been posting to Twitter and Facebook. Learn more about
planar motion tracking, rotoscoping and visual effects! (If you missed the
previous tip bundle, go here: vimeo.com/65153097) Tips covered in this bundle:
7\. Take a break now and then. You only have one pair of eyes. Well, at least
until they work out decent cybernetic implants. 8\. Adjust the amount of lines
in the grid by using the Viewer Preferences panel in the top right corner.
Also, use the grid! 9\. Don't be afraid to start again. Sometimes a fresh
layer is much more efficient than continually tweaking a problem one. You can
