<a name="anchor1"></a>**Get the Most Out of Mocha Within Adobe After Effects**

If you are working with Mocha AE (Adobe After Effects CC 2019) or have the Mocha Pro plug-in for After Effects, you have access to an extremely powerful tool. We use Mocha as a plug-in effect to create a number of common visual effects and fixes for problem footage. The aim of this course is to improve your skills in both Mocha and After Effects.

**Do It Right. Track Once. Use Often.**

The exercises start easily, analyzing shots to get the best motion tracking data. The next phase of the course looks at how we use this data with the plug-in version of Mocha. We work with match-moving and creating callouts, screen inserts, stabilization and rotoscoping to create masks.

The final part of the course focuses on a real-world example that uses all of our newly learned skills and adds some more advanced elements to it.

**Paced to Maximize Fast Learning**

The course is structured so that ideas and techniques developed throughout the training. This deepens the learning and is more effective than a simple tour around the interface and features. This is not just button pushing. It is about building concepts and connections between the two pieces of software.
