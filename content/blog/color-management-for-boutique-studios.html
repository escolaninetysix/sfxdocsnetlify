<h2>ACES, OCIO… What’s the Deal?</h2>

(<a title="ACES" href="https://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACES</a> is the Academy Color Encoding System; <a title="OCIO" href="https://opencolorio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCIO</a> stands for OpenColorIO.) Both color management initiatives emerged over the past decade, but now are gaining traction as need-to-know technologies. Both systems are business-minded responses to the unending profusion of formats that have appeared since digital replaced almost all film acquisition in movies and TV.</p>
<p>What’s the big deal? In the older days of analog film and television, there were few format choices to actually make in the overall post-production and delivery process beyond film stocks and tape formats. However, in today&#8217;s digital landscape there are more file formats, intermediate processes, codecs, and applications — all viewed on a myriad of devices and displays. Most camera companies have their own proprietary RAW file formats and almost all projects incorporate effects, graphics, legacy formats or stock footage… that all have their own color space. You get the idea. There is a lot of shared data being worked on, but not enough common definitions to ensure that what an editor sees on the monitor in their edit suite, is exactly the same through visual effects vendors, color grading, and broadcast.</p>

<h2 id="colorprimer">Color Primer</h2>
<p>Color theory is obviously a deep topic. Here is a quick primer on some basic color concepts to help you fully understand <b>logarithmic</b> and <b>linear</b> spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cameras measure light in f/stops or just stops.</li>
<li>Humans can see about 10 stops in daylight.</li>
<li>But in shadow or darkness humans can see 20 stops of light from black to white.</li>
</ul>
<p><center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411927/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_1.png" /></center></p>
<ul>
<li>Daylight covers a range of brightness wider than humans can see.</li>
<li>Cameras only record a portion of what humans can see.</li>
<li>To capture the full range of a daylight scene (dark to light) we have to compress the light to fit into the camera’s <a href="#dynamicrange" title="Dynamic Range" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Encoding that emulates the logarithmic way display devices and human perception process color and dynamic range.">dynamic range</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Light in the real world is linear.</li>
<li>If you shine a light on a table and then double the light and measure that with a light meter it will show 2X the light intensity. But human vision/perception doesn’t work that way.</li>
</ul>
<p><center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411927/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_2.png" /></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center></p>
<hr style="text-align: center;" width="25%" /></center></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans have more light sensitivity in darkness than in bright light.</li>
<li>This is probably evolutionary. 100,000 years ago having better night vision helped humans not become food.</li>
<li>This relationship of perception and light intensity is <b>non-linear</b>. Our eyes see light <b>logarithmically</b> as the graph below shows.</li>
</ul>
<p><center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411927/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_3.png" /></center></p>
<ul>
<li>In production, we work with both <b>linear</b> and <b>log</b> video files.</li>
<li>Cameras record in linear encoding and this is called <b>scene-referred</b> linear.</li>
<li>Display devices such as monitors and projectors are typically logarithmic to match how humans perceive light. These are called <b>display-referred</b> log.</li>
</ul>
<p><center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411927/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_4.png" /></center></p>

<p><i><b>When you bring <a href="#craw" title="Camera RAW" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="RAW is an image format that stores data from a digital camera sensor with minimal processing. A RAW file is uncompressed and not viewable without conversion to another format. Each camera, scanner manufacturer develops their own RAW format. There are over 100 RAW files in use. Most RAW formats use linear encoding.">camera RAW</a> into an application like Adobe Lightroom the RAW (linear) data is converted to Log when imported. This conversion is at the core of color management for film and video.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>In film/video production this conversion is performed many times. Color conversion can work both ways:<br />
<b>Linear to Log</b> OR <b>Log to Linear</b> depending on the operation such as VFX or color correction.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Colorists and VFX artists often need to work in linear color space, but can’t make artistic decisions in the flat looking image. So a LUT temporarily makes things look correct. Under the hood the file is still linear. After work is performed the linear file has the creative changes, but requires the LUT to view it properly. When applied correctly, the conversions preserve all the data.</b></i></p>
<p><center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1580411927/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_5_New.png" /></center><i>Linear encoding looks flat and washed out, but holds a great deal of data. Log encoding compresses the <a href="#dynamicrange" title="Dynamic Range" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Encoding that emulates the logarithmic way display devices and human perception process color and dynamic range.">dynamic range</a> to fit within the limits of a display device. However, it reduces the data for viewing purposes. So, linear encoding is great for capturing the greatest range of light, but log representation is better for viewing and working.</i></p>

<p><i>Below is a simplified version of a studio pipeline. In reality there would be more blocks and intricate relationships, but this serves the purpose of showing why color management is complex. For example, editorial could include several display monitors and a screening room each requiring color conversion.</i></p>
<p><i>Now consider what happens when there are three VFX studios around the world working on a show each with their own color pipeline. That means more conversions and the opportunity for errors. </i></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" style="display: block; text-align: center;" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411927/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_6.png" /></p>
<p><i>Between each node, a color conversion is applied with a LUT or a transform. In some cases, a file can be converted to a color space, worked on and then transformed back to the original incoming color space.</i></p>

<hr style="text-align: center;" width="25%" /></center></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Just as <b>log</b> and <b>linear</b> processing of light takes the human visual system into consideration, the same is true for color. Humans see a range of energy called the <b>visual spectrum</b>. Below is the <b>electromagnetic spectrum</b> that includes x-ray, gamma rays, radio waves, and the visual spectrum between approximately 380 to 740 nanometers or ultraviolet to infrared. </i></p>
<p><center><img class="img-responsive" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411926/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_7.png" /></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center></p>
<hr style="text-align: center;" width="25%" /></center></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1931, the CIE (Commission internationale de l’éclairage) created a color matching system. </p>
<p>It has been the global standard for colorimetry since then with a few important updates. The following is a condensed version but the main thing to understand is the <b>CIE Chromaticity Diagram</b> below.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; height: 60%; width: 55%; margin-right: 15px;" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411926/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_8.png" /></p>
<p>The outer boundary is the visual spectrum as if we bent the electromagnetic spectrum into a horseshoe shape. Colors along that line are the most saturated colors. The colors within the boundary are the colors human’s perceive.</p>
<p>The CIE diagram is defined by <a href="#rgb" title="RGB" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Red, Green, Blue. The primary colors in an additive color system.">RGB</a> colors based on <b>Tristimulus Color Theory</b> which basically states that all colors in the visual spectrum can be created with just three colors, red, green, and blue.</p>
<p>The black curved line towards the bottom of the diagram is the Planckian Locus and is used to indicate color temperature in degrees Kelvin. When R, G, and B have equal energy, the color is white. </p>
<p>The CIE diagram is a 2D rendition of a 3D color cube.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center></p>
<hr style="text-align: center;" width="25%" /></center></p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" style="float: right; height: 40%; width: 35%; margin-left: 15px;" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1580411926/blog/ocio/INFO_GRAF_9.png" />
<p>Here’s a look at color spaces you’re probably familiar with projected on the CIE diagram. The triangles are color spaces formed by red, green, and blue primaries at the vertices. They are subsets of the full visual spectrum meaning colors are left out if they don’t lie within the triangle. Color spaces can be defined by anyone and many companies do. Establishing a standard is much more difficult.</p>
<p><b>Rec. 2020</b> is a recommended color space for Ultra high-definition television. It has a much wider <a href="#gamut" title="Gamut" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="The complete range of colors in a color space defined by the location of the RGB primaries.">gamut</a> than color spaces in use. The wide <a href="#gamut" title="Gamut" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="The complete range of colors in a color space defined by the location of the RGB primaries.">gamut</a> was chosen in the interest of future proofing.</p>
<p><b>Rec. 709</b> is the official standard for high-definition television HDTV.</p>
<p><b>DCI-P3</b> is the standard for digital projection for theatrical exhibition. </p>
<p>Standards are set by <a href="#smpte" title="SMPTE" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. Founded in 1916, SMPTE is a global professional organization of engineers, scientists, and executives working in motion pictures and television.

<p><i>Does it allow other operations to be done in the proper color space? Not all operations are intended to be done in Scene Referred Linear. For example, many final color looks are intended to be applied to a LOG image. </i></p>
<p><i>Can it handle conversions for all incoming and outgoing formats robustly (Alexa C Log, Cineon Log with all of the original parameters, S-Log, Rec 709, etc.)?

Lighting in the real world might work in a linear fashion, but Log space is a better approximation to the way we see and most display devices work.</p>
<p>Haney’s second requirement: Making sure operations, such as applying a color filter, are always done in the appropriate color space, linear or log. </p>
<p><i>“Operations that work well in linear space are 3D rendering, photorealistic compositing transparencies (fog, glass), optical effects (lens blur, motion blur, lens flares), and transforms with anti-alias filters, sub-pixel positioning, etc.</i></p>

<p>It can be unrealistic to expect this kind of pipeline upgrade to be completely without bumps along the road, especially at smaller studios that rely on a core staff of full-time artists mixed with freelancers who have to be brought up to speed on file management and workflows.

It was under development as late as the end of 2018.

<p>This is a step forward in organizing and archiving show data. Consider what happens when a show made in 2012 releases a director’s cut in 2020. A facility has to reconstruct the movie including new material and perhaps a re-edit. What if the director also wants to modify the look of the delivered show? This would require all the transforms and looks that were layered into the final archived show. Normally, reconstructing the show would be a nightmare, but <a href="#aces" title="ACES" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Academy Color Encoding System.

Bair sees this as an important development but would like even more metadata:</p>
<p><i>“Most of the time we are delivered EXRs which have been converted from the RAW camera files by a post-processing facility. Thankfully it is becoming more common for all metadata to freely pass through the transcoding process. While it is not quite there yet, we are on the verge of having a thorough and complex set of metadata baked into every camera source. It will be incredibly helpful for us, as a VFX studio, to have all color information, lensing, camera translation, etc., always available in our source plates.”</i></p>

<p>Again, user error and lack of documentation was a common theme in our interviews. In new complex systems, people make mistakes.</p>

<p>Haney points out:</p>
<p><i>“At the end of the day, we are making art and are required to deliver it to the client in the color space they have defined. If the smartest programmers in the world have a system that is technically correct but leads the average artist to output images with wrong gamma or color, then I consider that system to be flawed and a liability to my business. Adobe products can be difficult in this way. Some operations/effects do not work in float. Adobe Photoshop&#8217;s CMS was built for print and does not lend itself to film. Adobe After Effects’ CMS can also lead to output problems. We have had better success with Nuke and the open source <a title="OCIO for After Effects" href="http://fnordware.blogspot.com/2012/05/opencolorio-for-after-effects.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCIO for After Effects</a> for select operations in AE.” </i></p>
<p>Crist also sees user error as high on the list of challenges in his job:<br />
<i>“Sometimes someone upstream can make a mistake. I&#8217;ve had plates delivered at the wrong color space, incorrect <a href="#luts" title="LUTs" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="An acronym that represents Look Up Tables. A table of RGB input and output values to convert one color space to another. LUTs can be 1D and 3D.">LUTs</a>, and CCC files break. It&#8217;s hard to say when or where the errors occur until you really test each and every file bit by bit. Color still seems to very much be a manual process that requires a really keen and technical eye to oversee and I don&#8217;t think <a href="#aces" title="ACES" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Academy Color Encoding System. A color management framework consisting of new color spaces standardized by SMPTE. LUTs and transforms convert common display and camera devices through delivery and archiving.">ACES</a> has really fixed that yet.”</i></p>
<p>Nuget’s experience with clients is mixed:<br />
<i>“I think a lot of the bigger productions know more about color in general. I work in docs a lot, and to be honest, either this never even comes up, or they just rely on me to make the decisions and create the workflow environment. From what I’ve seen, the VFX industry is more aware and capable of working in a color-managed environment, smaller shops, not so much.”</i></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Constant and fast-moving change is a certainty in the digital era. Cameras and devices continue to advance. HDR is now a standard feature on most displays and new monitors may soon have a fourth and fifth color primaries. The <a href="#dynamicrange" title="Dynamic Range" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Encoding that emulates the logarithmic way display devices and human perception process color and dynamic range.">dynamic range</a> of cameras will increase and bring more factors to color management. <a href="#aces" title="ACES" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Academy Color Encoding System.

<p><a name="craw"></a>CAMERA RAW<br />
RAW is an image format that stores data from a digital camera sensor with minimal processing. A RAW file is uncompressed and not viewable without conversion to another format. Each camera, scanner manufacturer develops their own RAW format. There are over 100 RAW files in use. Most RAW formats use linear encoding.</p>
<p><a name="braw"></a>BRAW<br />
Blackmagic Design’s RAW format (BRAW) with light compression is used in all BlackMagic Design cameras and in their color grading software DaVinci Resolve. The format is a non-linear 12-bit color space and is smaller than most other RAW formats.</p>
<p><a name="cinemadng"></a>CinemaDNG<br />
Adobe introduced its own RAW video format in 2008 with the goal of industry-wide adoption. However, it has not sought standardization from SMPTE or the ISO.</p>
<p><a name="primcolors"></a>Primary Colors<br />
Red, green, and blue make up the three primary colors. In an additive color system such as slide film, projection, and colored lights, the colors produce white light when mixed in equal proportion. In any other proportion, they mix to create all the colors humans can seen.</p>
