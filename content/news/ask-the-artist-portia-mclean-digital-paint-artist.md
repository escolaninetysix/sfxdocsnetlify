**Where are you from and how did you get your start in the industry?** I knew I wanted to be a professional artist as I worked my way through school, but was unsure about the reality of achieving that in the traditional sphere. Luckily, being a native New Zealander, and having Weta Digital nearby, I managed to slide my foot in the door of the feature film industry. I made a successful application for an entry-level rotoscoping job with some drawings and a couple of homemade stop-motion films to show for myself. I’ve now spent 7 years here, and am a painter.

**What project are you most proud of and why?** _The Planet of the Apes_ trilogy and _Alita: Battle Angel_ felt like major visual effects feats, so I was pleased to have been involved with them! But I’d have to say I was most excited by _Game of Thrones_ (Season 8) — as a fan myself, helping out with making the pop-culture phenomenon has been a great source of pride.

**How do you prep before a big project?** All year round, every year, is go! Making sure I get a good holiday, would be my answer! An annual end-of-year pilgrimage with my partner generally resets me and prepares me for the year to come. Going somewhere beautiful and serene within New Zealand has become a tradition.

**What are your go-to Boris FX products and which effect/features do you rely on most?** [Silhouette](https://borisfx.com/products/silhouette/?collection=silhouette&product=silhouette) and [Mocha Pro](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/). I predominantly ‘hand paint’ at work which involves frame by frame rebuilding of organic and quite often complex elements within shots. The speed at which I can achieve in Silhouette makes the job much less painful — and genuinely satisfying. And for more procedural tasks, you can’t beat Mocha as a tracker.

**What’s a keyboard shortcut you can’t live without?** My answer to this is not a very controversial one. Ctrl-Z. As a traditional artist also, I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve held a pencil in my hand and after making an unintentional mark, mentally tried to ‘Ctrl-Z’ the blunder.

**How do you keep yourself fueled/your favorite snack when you’re in an epic session?** Usually, if I am racing the clock, just a flat white with a dash of cinnamon does the trick for me!

**Where do you turn for creative inspiration?** Listening to music gives me staying power at my desk!

**What do you do when you start feeling creative burnout?** I am lucky to say that my job doesn’t burn me out creatively. Sometimes the work can be detailed and tedious, but digital paint is satisfying.

**What’s your favorite film and/or TV series?** _Game of Thrones_, _The Dark Crystal,_ anything Aardman - especially _Wallace & Gromit_. I love anything stop-motion, surreal, or absurd.

**If you could collaborate with any director/producer/editor living or dead, who would it be and why?** Everybody involved in TOOL’s music videos. I’m a lover of the music, imagery, and stop motion. Growing up watching those videos really inspired me.

**What career and/or life advice would you give your younger self?** Have more confidence in your ability. Everybody at one stage or another pretends that they know what they’re doing.
