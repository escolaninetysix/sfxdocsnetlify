**_Particle Illusion Enhancements:_**

* 3D
  * Emit particles in a 3D environment including host camera integration
* Turbulence
  * Add organically evolving randomized variation to particle Size and Position based on a noise map field.
* Lines
  * Add Lines connecting particles to each other, to their emitter location, or to their birth position for a wide range of new looks.
* Deflector - Randomization
  * Particles can now pick up variable randomization in their bounce pattern after colliding with a deflector to give a much more natural scattering effect.
* Deflector - Particle Break
  * Particles can now break into separate sub-particles after hitting a deflector.
* Updated Library View
  * The Library View in the emitter browsing pane (as opposed to the Grid and Thumbnail views) has been refactored to be cleaner and easier to use.
* New "Emitters_2021" Emitter Library and Presets
* Other PI Enhancements
  * Expose random seed parameters for particle types and free emitter types
  * Add motion blur frames indicator to particle count display
  * Added Pref for disabling the Render Finished chime
  * Added Pref for default keyframe type
  * Default to Grid view for new installs
  * Added Menu command for File->Render
  * Stage / Playback UI - updated layout and look
  * When a stage emitter is selected in the Controls View, the "Return/Enter" key initiates "Rename"
  * Add pref to show or hide stage/project info
  * Force and Deflector buttons now act as auto-toggles which instantly add an element to the timeline to avoid confusion
  * Alt-click on stage position keys toggles linear/bezier like in graph view

**_Title Studio Enhancements:_**

* Procedural Noise texture generators which enable many new texture/bump map looks and also improved accuracy when importing C4D models.  Procedural Noise texture generators can be added to an object by first changing the material track to any texture option (except color and flat color). In the texture channel track, change the track media to Procedural to access an array of texture noise options.
* Multi-Texture options for combining multiple texture sources into a single hybrid texture and for improved accuracy when importing C4D models. A New Multi-Texture shader can be applied to your scene or objects by selecting Texture Composite from the Image Processors category in the Shaders Menu.
* Improved C4D import including more accurate rendering and faster performance with complex models.
* UI Enhancements including switching to Inter UI font for TS UI on mac for better legibility across various resolutions

**_Primatte Studio:_**

* Integrated Edge Cleaner - New Edge Cleaner tool which uses advanced filtering techniques to clean up the edges of rough keys without degrading clean edges and including a temporal correlation technique to minimize chatter in grainy or compressed chroma key footage.  This is integrated directly into Primatte Studio in all hosts, and it comes in standalone form for Adobe hosts only.  Note this is specifically designed to work with keyed footage, not synthetic alpha edges such as graphics.
* Resolve now supports Spill Removal Method of Softened Background and Light Wrap based on background when applied in Resolve's Color pane with the background image piped into the node.
* Guidance message added when Spill Removal Method of Softened Background is used but when no Background layer has been selected/piped in.

**_Mocha Updates Including Adjust Track V2:_**

* AdjustTrack V2:  AdjustTrack has been completely overhauled to be easier to use and less prone to errors.
* Numerous miscellaneous fixes and tweaks

**_Mocha Data in Continuum Presets:_**

* Continuum presets have been redesigned to include all Mocha tracking data - both PixelChooser masks and parameter tracking.  You can now save a preset in one host and migrate it to another host with all Mocha data intact.  The previous preference setting for whether or not to include PixelChooser data when loading presets has been expanded to cover all Mocha data as well, and we've added a new toggle for this pref inside the FX Browser.  When you want to move an EXACT setting from one instance to another you can enable the pref to include the PixelChooser and Mocha data when loading presets and this choice is reflected in the FX Browser preview.  When you disable this pref you can instead browse different preset looks without replacing any underlying Mocha masking or parameter tracking.

**_Preset sharing:_**

* BCC presets have moved to a new location shared between all hosts.  This means that any custom presets created in one host will automatically be available for all other hosts on the same system.  E.g. a preset saved in AE will automatically show up in AVX and vice versa.  The new preset location for Continuum effects (but not the BCC+ effects) is:
  * C:\\ProgramData\\BorisFX\\Continuum\\14\\Presets
  * Library/Application Support/BorisFX/BCC Presets 14

**_OFX Performance:_**

* OFX infrastructure performance improvements both when scrubbing or when rendering in OFX hosts.

**_Misc. Performance enhancements:_**

* FX Browser playback/scrubbing speed, esp. in float projects
* Title Studio CTI scrubbing.

**_Expanded Temporal Filters in Resolve:_**

* We now take advantage of features in Resolve 15/16 or higher to support filters which require temporal frame access at widely different times - namely Optical Flow, Looper, Velocity Remap, Trails, and Trails Basic.

**_Other Fixes and Polish in Continuum 2021:_**

* Installer - Mac warnings in install log

**Continuum 2021 v14.0.0 for OFX - New BCC+ Filter Integration Notes:**

You will notice several differences between the new BCC+ filters and the existing BCC effects in the 2021 cycle.  Several standard Continuum features and workflow metaphors have not yet been added to the new filters.  We will continue to refine the integration in future versions:

* The new filters do not support the PixelChooser, Mocha Masking and Tracking, Compare Mode, Beat Reactor, or Head Up Display widgets.
* The new filters use the new FX Editor preset browser, while the old filters will continue to use the original FX Browser.
* The new filters do all preset loading/saving from within the FX Editor.  There are no native host controls for loading/saving/browsing presets.
* The new filters do not appear in the standalone FX Browser filter

**Continuum 2021 (v14.0.0) for OFX - Compatibility Notes:**

While in general your previously saved projects should render identically in the newer version, bug fixes and quality improvements can sometimes change the look of older projects. While every effort is made to ensure project compatibility, the following notable areas may see some change to the look of previously saved projects.

* Fixes to the Particle Illusion layer order may affect the look of old projects if they contained multiple layers inside the Particle Illusion UI (not common).  Layers cannot be reordered at this time.
* Fixes to the Particle Illusion Particle Type handling may slightly affect the look of old projects, particularly if they used multiple Particle Type instances.  The exact randomization pattern may be different, but the overall look and feel should remain the same.

**Continuum 2021.0 (v14.0.0) for OFX - Known Issues and Limitations:**

* CO-5788 - Particle Illusion - custom GUI scroll bars do not react to Wacom tablet clicks.
* CO-8319 - Particle Illusion - Missing top window bar to minimize or maximize when reopened on secondary monitor in some circumstances.
* CO-8221 - Particle Illusion - broken particles occasionally falling through deflector
* CO-8395 - Particle Illusion - DOF can be unexpectedly slow on AMD cards
* CO-8060 - Particle Illusion - Motion blur calculation does not take into account camera motion
* CO-8424 - Particle Illusion - Center emitter widget drifts away from mouse cursor after changing layer angle/position param
* CO-8454 - Particle Illusion - when emitter position Z value is non-zero, dragging emitter on stage sets it to 0
* CO-8432 - BCC+ filters such as X-Ray can lose the source clip's alpha channel in some OFX hosts depending on premultiplication properties.  This can be partially worked around by adding a normal BCC effect after the BCC+ effect.
* CO-8426 - OFX: Image/s are flipped for Transitions in FX Browser in some OFX hosts
* CO-8477 - Particle Illusion - Some 3D views are black or partially rendered when motion blur enabled

* CO-8434 - Particle Illusion - Position Turbulence can cause particles to go through deflectors
* CO-8474 - Particle Illusion - Switching to Top View can cause sporadic crashing on MacOS 10.13
* CO-8490 - Particle Illusion - Appling Mocha World/Emitter tracking or native World/Emitter adjustments does not work as expected for PI projects with internal 3D camera offsets.
* CO-8498 - Title Studio - C4D objects can disappear when Procedural texture is applied
* CO-8480 - Mocha Motion Tracking sporadically displays gray frames and fails to track entire clip in Vegas
