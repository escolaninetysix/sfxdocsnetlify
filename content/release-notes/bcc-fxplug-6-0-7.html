<p>
 BCC FxPlug 6.0.7
 <br>
 New Features and Improvements
 <br>
 • Improvements in memory handling for BCC Optical Stabilizer, Pan and Zoom, Motion Key, Degrain,
 <br>
 Match Grain. Some filters in previous versions of BCC displayed memory issues when using image files
 <br>
 large dimensions. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
 <br>
 • Long drive names no longer cause a problem when using BCC 6 on the Macintosh platform. In
 <br>
 previous versions of BCC 6, Macintosh systems that used drives with excessively long names caused
 <br>
 problems for the BCC filters. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
 <br>
 • BCC 3D Objects host support extended to include Final Cut Express. In previous versions of BCC 6,
 <br>
 the 3D Objects category of filters were not supported in the Apple Motion host application. This issue
 <br>
 has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
 <br>
 • BCC Witness Protection filter now correctly interprets video fields. In previous versions of BCC 6, the
 <br>
 Witness Protection filter did not interpret video fields from the host correctly, resulting in an incorrect
 <br>
 result. This issue has been resolved with the 6.0.7 release.
 <br>
 • In the Apple Motion host, the BCC Optical Stabilizer filter exhibited problems with image analysis when
 <br>
 used in 32 bit color mode. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
 <br>
 • The BCC Matte Choker filter was generating an incorrect result when the Gaussian Blur option was
 <br>
 selected from the Blur Quality pop-up. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
 <br>
 • Overall stability improvements when using BCC filters with multi-layered sequences in the Final Cut
 <br>
 Pro host.
 <br>
 Important Note
 <br>
 We highly recommend that any mounted disc drives contain less than 27 characters in the drive name
 <br>
 and that special characters or symbols should be avoided when using BCC filters on Macintosh
 <br>
 systems. Non-adherence to this recommendation may result in instability in the host environment.
