:Revision:  mocha Pro Plugin 5.0.0

== Introduction
These release notes accompany *{revision}*. 

Documentation is available inside *{revision}* by pressing the F1 key.

== Build notes

Note that Python is not supported in the plugin. This means any tools created by Python will not be functional. This includes some exports, such as Fusion and Silhouette shapes. You will need to use the standalone.

Please also note the defect "DE4356 First attempt at exporting data to AE will not paste for mocha Pro Plugin" in the Known Defects below. 

This is an After Effects software limitation where a clipboard check issue causes After Effects to not paste data after exporting and closing the mocha Pro Plugin.

Until this can be addressed by Adobe, the workaround is to switch out of After Effects to another application and back again. This will force After Effects to check the clipboard again.


== New Features Guide

This release contains new features, including:


* Loading Media Composer, After Effects or Premiere layers directly to mocha
* Bringing layer mattes directly back to Media Composer, After Effects or Premiere
* Rendering directly from mocha back to  Media Composer, After Effects or Premiere
* Creating native masks from the After Effects plugin interface
* Creating tracking data points from the plugin interface (After Effects only)
* GPU acceleration
* New licensing method


=== Loading Media Composer, After Effects or Premiere layers directly to mocha
You can now load mocha Pro directly as a plugin to a layer. This means that you don't need to set up a project or worry about format, compatibility issues and so on.


=== Bringing layer mattes directly back to Media Composer, After Effects or Premiere
Instead of having to export your layer shapes to the clipboard, you can now just close mocha and any visible mattes will automatically mask out the layer back in the timeline if "Apply Matte" is turned on.

If you want to keep editing the masks, you can simply launch the mocha Pro interface again, modify, and close again.

You can still import and export standard mocha projects, but the plugin project data is stored inside the host project file.

You can now apply the matte to cut out renders or the original source, or view the black and white matte.

If you want to control the visibility of mattes you can either go back into mocha, or control it via the "Choose Layer" option in the GUI. 

Any visible layers changed by the Choose Layers dialog will affect:

* View Matte
* Apply Matte
* Create AE Masks (After Effects only)


=== Rendering directly from mocha back to Media Composer, After Effects or Premiere
You can now read in a native layer in your comp or sequence as an insert clip and then render the output of the mocha insert right in Avid, AE or Premiere.

You can also set up Lens Distortion, Removes and Stabilize renders and render them back to the host.

This means you don't need to render or export a render inside the mocha application. You can instead do it right from the host timeline.


=== Creating AE masks from the plugin interface (After Effects only)
Rather than exporting from mocha, you can now create native AE masks directly from the shown mattes in the plugin interface.

The "Create AE Masks" button will create a new set of masks on the same layer as the plugin. 


=== Creating tracking data points from the plugin interface (After Effects only)
Rather than exporting from mocha, you can now create native AE control points directly from a selected layer in the plugin interface.

Selecting a layer from the "Choose layer" button will generate a series of tracking points you can then link to via expressions.

If the surface of the chosen layer is updated in the mocha GUI, the point keyframes are updated back in the AE timeline.


=== GPU acceleration
Just like the standalone mocha Pro, you can now use the GPU to speed up tracking. 

GPU tracking requires OpenCL 1.2. Graphics cards manufactured since around 2012 will support this but might require an updated driver from the manufacturer.

There are known problems with the NVIDIA graphics driver included in all current versions of Mac OS X. To use an NVIDIA GPU on Mac, please install the updated driver available via the NVIDIA website.

.To turn on GPU tracking:
. Go to mocha preferences
. Go to the GPU page
. Turn on "Track using GPU"
. Choose your appropriate GPU device or leave it as "Automatic"
. Restart mocha

NOTE: GPU tracking currently does not support clips modified by the Lens module or interlaced footage. In these cases, mocha will automatically switch back to CPU tracking.


=== New licensing method
This edition also introduces a new licensing format to help make activation and deactivation easier for your licenses.

.To license the mocha Pro Plugin:
. Click on 'Licensing' check box in the plugin interface
. Enter your details into the Registration dialog
. Paste or enter your serial number
. Click 'Next'.
. Click 'Activate'.
. You will then see a screen telling you the Activation status, with an option to deactivate again.
