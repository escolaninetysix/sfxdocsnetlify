  <u>
   Fixed Issues:
  </u>
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 • On Windows systems, in Filter Palette window the default All Filters set was not listed under Sets menu. It is listed now.
</p>
<p>
 • RED did not ask to re-link missing media when projects from Windows system was moved to a Macintosh system. Now it does put up a dialog box for re-linking missing media.
</p>
<p>
 • Gradient window had UI redraw problems such as the word Gradient would be truncated &amp; an extra non-functional button would show up next o the Angle control. These problems are fixed now.
</p>
<p>
 • When using Clone tool, if Graph View was changed then RED would stop responding. This is fixed now so that you can change Graph View when working with Clone tool.
</p>
<p>
 • Trails and flickering effects would show up when rendering DV sized projects with Sphere Transitions effects. This is fixed now.
</p>
<p>
 • When a BCC effect was applied to a track, the various Interactors’ Controllers were available on a track below it even though that track had no BCC effect applied. Now the Interactors’ Controllers only show up for the track to which the filter effect is applied.
</p>
<p>
 • Scroll wheel would lose the focus &amp; scroll down the Composite window when selecting the Controls window. This is fixed now &amp; scroll wheel retains the focus of the active window.
</p>
<p>
 • On Macintosh systems, there was no “clear” divider between All Filters &amp; the saved sets under Set menu in Filter Palette. Now there is a divider clearly separating these menu items.
</p>
<p>
 • On Windows systems the default All Filters set was not listed under Sets menu in Filter Palette. It is now listed.
</p>
<p>
 • Workspace menu was grayed out once Library Browser workspace was opened. This is now fixed &amp; Workspace menu is now available.
</p>
<p>
 • You could not delete a filter from your Comp tab while a keyframe was selected in your timeline. Now you can, as the timeline window’s focus changes accordingly.
</p>
<p>
 • On Screen Widgets would disappear or get squished when dragged outside video area in Composite window. This is fixed so the widgets do not disappear anymore.
</p>
<p>
 • Having paint effect applied would hide video in Composite window when re-entering RED from the Host. This is fixed so that the video is now visible.
</p>
<p>
 • RED would stop responding when attempting to stop a render in progress. This is fixed &amp; RED does not stop responding when render is stopped.
</p>
<p>
 • On Macintosh systems, importing subtitle would sometimes make RED stop responding as it tried to render text at the end. This is fixed &amp; RED does not hang anymore.
</p>
<p>
 • On Macintosh systems, toggling between Stacked Bars and Horizontal Bars in Charts would sometimes make RED stop responding. This is fixed so now toggling between bars is possible.
</p>
<p>
 • Styles Palette’ extrusion editor had UI redraw problems. The editor UI window would not draw when launched and it did not show controls in other tabs within the window. The UI redraw problems have been fixed now.
</p>
<p>
 • On Macintosh systems, RED would stop responding when line chart width was increased in Graph View &amp; if Show All Modified was selected. Now RED does not hang when line chart width parameter is adjusted.
</p>
<p>
 • On Macintosh systems, RED would stop responding when importing audio with Graph View open. Now you can import audio with Graph View open.
</p>
<p>
 • Applying a style after Un-doing an applied filter would make the Host stop responding. This is fixed now &amp; the Host does not hang.
</p>
<p>
 • Mouse scroll wheel would automatically switch between controlling zoom and Comp window scroll bar. This is fixed &amp; now mouse scroll wheel works as expected.
</p>
<p>
 • In Graph View, you could drag the keyframes vertically and horizontally only for Ease In Ease Out, not for Linear and the others. Now you can drag the keyframes.
</p>
<p>
 • Timeline tab would be locked to position of toolbar &amp; hence could not be moved. This is fixed &amp; it does not happen anymore.
</p>
<p>
 • On Windows systems, RED was missing information for additional columns in Control Panel. This is fixed now so you get proper info in the displayed columns.

  Avid Media Composer:

</p>
<p>
 <br>
 • Paint effect did not apply back to host (Avid). Now it does apply back to Avid.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 <br>
 <b>
  Media 100 Suite:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 • Media 100 Suite would stop responding if more than one RED/BCC effect was applied in a track. Fixed, so now you can stack different effects.
</p>
<p>
 • Media 100 Suite would stop responding upon quitting it if RED was applied. This is now fixed &amp; Media 100 Suite does not hang anymore.

 To minimize the artifacts, in Controls window, select Enable Back Bevels in 3D Style tab for the main Chart

<p>
 under Extrusion tab for the individual chart tracks. De-selecting Back Face Culling for individual chart tracks may help also.

  After Effects:

</p>
<p>
 • Extruded text gets cutoff when previewing in AE Comp window.
</p>
<p>

  Premiere Pro:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • On Macintosh systems, Open Tab in New Window is grayed out when right clicking on Text tab.
</p>
<p>
 • Changes made to a RED effect that has already been rendered in Premiere Pro are not recognized in Premiere Pro.
</p>
<p>
 • Importing a saved paint project into RED, launched as a plug-in through Premiere Pro, and applying back to Host gives the wrong frame size in Premiere Pro.
</p>
<p>
 • Too many paint strokes in RED causes you to save your project after hitting apply and Premiere Pro stops responding.
</p>
<p>

 <b>
  Sony Vegas Pro:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • The frame that Vegas Video passes to RED does not necessarily match the Vegas project size. Instead this frame is the same size as the frame displayed in the Vegas Preview window. Any Preview window setting will work, but best results are achieved by setting the Preview window to Best/Full before launching Boris RED.
</p>
<p>
 • In order for Boris RED 5 effects to render correctly in Sony Vegas Pro, it is necessary that the effects be rendered at the same frame rate as the project. It's possible to create an output of the effects at a different frame rate, but in order to do so it is necessary to first render the RED effects to another track or selectively pre-render the RED effects at the project frame rate and then render at the other desired frame rate while referencing the pre-rendered video.
</p>
<p>
 • When launching RED from Sony Vegas sometimes no video shows up in RED Composite Window.
</p>
<p>
 • Changes made in the RED plug-in UI are not recognized by Sony Vegas as unsaved changes.
</p>
<p>
 Please make sure to save the project before quitting Sony Vegas to save any changes made in RED effects.
