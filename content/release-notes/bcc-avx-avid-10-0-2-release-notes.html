<p> </p>
<p><strong>BCC AVX 10.x Compatibility Notes: </strong><br>While in general your previously saved projects should render identically in the newer version, bug fixes and quality improvements can sometimes change the look of older projects. While every effort is made to ensure project compatibility, the following notable areas may see some change to the look of previously saved projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Render quality improvements in Fast Film Glow when applied to alpha clips may result in some changes to glow brightness and/or extent.</li>
<li>Render quality improvements with Extrusion Styles in 3D Objects filters may result in changes to the extrusion thickness.</li>
<li>Rays Dissolve - a fix to the Region Animation rotation control will cause the region size to appear slightly larger when opening saved projects which used the Region Animation option.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BCC AVX 10.0.2 - Known Issues and Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Combining 3D Objects filters with other OpenGL accelerated BCC filters such as Lens Flare 3D or Grunge requires at least 2GB graphics card memory for HD projects and higher for 4K. [30395]</li>
<li>
<span>PixelChooser</span> - shape feathering option is not implemented in OpenGL filters. [497]</li>
<li>mocha PixelChooser - mocha track data is not saved with presets.  To clone mocha tracking data from one effect instance or machine or host to another, you can use the File-&gt;Export Project and File-&gt;Merge Project options from within the mocha UI. [645]</li>
<li>mocha PixelChooser - tracking data does not adjust if the user changes the clip trim on the front end of the clip after tracking.  The clip will need to be re-tracked if the trim is changed on the front.  You can minimize the amount of re-tracking by re-aligning the contours within the mocha UI with the Ubey-key, offsetting the contour to re-align it, and then re-tracking the remainder as necessary. [1076]</li>
<li>PixelChooser - Circle and Egg Shape can show stretched shapes or feathering when in interlaced projects and set to Speed Optimized. As a workaround you can change the Fields menu in the General Controls group to Quality Optimized. [1107]</li>
<li>
<span>PixelChooser</span> - Circle and Egg Shape modes render incorrectly in OpenGL filters on Avid. [1070]</li>
<li>
<span>PixelChooser</span>- feathering always uses a mirror-edge treatment which can cause masks near the edge of the screen to extend instead of fading. [400]</li>
<li>Geometrics drop shadow option in OpenGL filters can produce unexpected colors. [877]</li>
<li>Optical Stabilizer, inserting a transition at the head of the stabilized clip makes it lose stabilization &amp; the filter has to be re-analyzed. [431]</li>
<li>Title Studio Plugin Mac - Menu Bar doesn't update back when toggling apps until you cancel or apply from Title Studio UI. [1539]</li>
<li>BCC Motion Blur now includes an Advanced optical flow option which uses OpenCL hardware assisted rendering to implement a more sophisticated (and more computationally intensive) motion vector analysis.  The performance of the Advance mode varies widely from one graphics card to another and if you see reduced performance or unexpected results when using the Advanced option it is recommended that you switch to the Simple mode on that card. [706 + 1094]</li>
<li>mocha PixelChooser - export to BCC motion tracker formats requires the host application be set to full resolution for the exported track data to be correctly scaled. [1675]</li>
<li>Title Studio - The Frame Cache is not automatically Purged when you manually change the PAR (pixel aspect ratio). [1964]</li>
</ul>
