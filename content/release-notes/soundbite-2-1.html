New Feature:
Soundbite 2.1 can now import Final Cut X projects. In FCP X, you can export any events via FCPX XML, which can then be imported into Soundbite. Each event will be treated as a Final Cut project within Soundbite, with all media resources from that FCPX event being indexed and searchable.

All the functionality within Soundbite for watchfolders and Final Cut Pro 7 projects will also apply to FCP X projects, so this includes indexing, searching, previewing, grouping, and saving. Resources can be exported back to FCP X with markers for hits using the "Export to FCPX XML" feature.
One thing to note is that a session of Soundbite can either work with FCP7 or FCPX, but not both simultaneously. You can switch between the two modes in the preference-&gt;advanced tab; it only requires a restart of Soundbite. No data is lost switching between FCP7 and FCPX modes.
So the workflow follows these steps:
<ol>
 <li>
  In Soundbite, go to preferences, choose FCPX. Restart.
 </li>
 <li>
  In FCP X, choose which event you wish to export, right click, export as XML.
 </li>
 <li>
  In Soundbite, add the FCP project, then choose that XML file. Soundbite will add the project and index all resources.
 </li>
 <li>
  Use Soundbite however you want with that project.
 </li>
</ol>
