 The following is a listing of the known problems in the product at time of shipping:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Clicking rapidly on the font selector button in the BCS Title Flare filter can lead to instability in the Final Cut Pro host.
 </li>
 <li>
  Clicking on the reset button to reset parameter controls will not reset the controls if a group is collapsed – open the group before pressing the reset to workaround this issue.
 </li>
 <li>
  Clicking on the load button for presets in the Title Flare filter defaults to the last opened folder and not the Title Flare presets folder – manually locate the folder to workaround this issue.
 </li>
 <li>
  Motion can become unstable when the Optical Stabilizer filter is analyzing a clip in 16 bit – to workaround this host issue, perform Optical Stabilizer image analysis in 8 bit.
 </li>
</ul>
