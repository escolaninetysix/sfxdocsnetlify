 Introduction
</p>
<p>
 Welcome to Boris Continuum Complete for AVX version 4.1. These Release Notes contain information regarding supported hosts, supported operating systems, installation instructions, known limitations, and other important information about the product.
</p>
<p>
 Boris Continuum Complete AVX (BCC AVX) runs on both the AVX 2.0 and AVX 1.5 architecture. BCC AVX is a suite of native plug-ins that streamline workflow for Avid editors. More than 170 sophisticated filters and transitions are applied and animated directly in the Avid Effect Editor window. A subset of the filters preview in real time on supported systems. BCC AVX is bundled with all Avid Media Composer Adrenaline systems.
</p>
<p>
 Since the release of BCC AVX 4.0, you can access Avid's advanced keyframing model (AVX 2.0 only). Instead of being limited to 8-bit color depth, the filters offer 16-bit processing (AVX 2.0 only). The PixelChooser option that lets users create an animatable vector-based mask now includes bezier handles for more precise control. A new Motion key feature isolates and removes moving foreground objects based on motion estimation. New filters have been added as well as improved motion tracking.
</p>
<p>
 For information on new features in BCC AVX, see the New Features Guide.PDF on your Boris CD.

   Supported Real-Time Avid Hosts
  </p>
  <p>
   Supported real-time systems include Xpress Pro 5.1.4 or later, and systems with Adrenaline hardware. The real-time effect playback is largely determined by the speed of the system hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
   These filters are intended to provide real-time Draft-Quality previews. You should render these filters before outputting to tape, even on systems with Mojo or Adrenaline hardware. You do not have to replace the real-time filters with the corresponding non-real-time filter. Simply render the real-time filter.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Supported Operating Systems and Hardware
  </p>
  <p>
   Boris Continuum Complete AVX RT requires the following operating systems and hardware:
  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   Windows
  </p>
  <p>
   The BCC AVX RT plug-ins require a Pentium 3 or Pentium 4 processor running Windows XP® as well as Avid Adrenaline or Mojo hardware.
  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   Macintosh
  </p>
  <p>
   The BCC AVX RT plug-ins require a Macintosh system running a minimum of Mac OS™ X 10.2.8 or above as well as Avid Adrenaline or Mojo hardware.
  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   Important Notes on the BCC Real-time Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   The real-time effect playback is largely determined by the speed of the system hardware. Additionally, real-time playback depends on the settings you adjust in the effect. If you adjust multiple parameters, it is likely the effect will not play back in realtime. For example, if you apply blur and choke to a PixelChooser matte, the filter may require rendering.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you work with the real-time filters, the Fields menu only applies when you render the effect. It does not affect previews and playback. For details, see 11Working with the General Controls Parameter Group" in your User Guide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although some real-time filters may include the Motion Tracker parameter groups, you should not use the real-time version of a filter to motion track. Use the non-real-time version.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
   BCC AVX real-time filters are not fast enough to apply to Avid titles and play back in real time. Therefore, the real-time version of BCC AVX filters do not include a Title Matte parameter group. Use the non-real-time version to apply to a title or matte.
  </p>
  <p>
   To achieve real-time playback of BCC AVX RT plug-ins without dropped frames, make sure that your system meets the following requirements.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Set your Avid to real-time Playback mode (green dot in the Timeline, not blue dot).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Open your project's Video Display settings and set Real-time Effect Quality to High Performance (more simultaneous effects). This increases the system's ability to process effects at the expense of reducing image quality.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Use the Expert Render command on parts of the sequence where the system has difficulties during playback.The system marks these sections of the sequence in the Timeline. For more information, see your Avid documentation.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If possible, start playback earlier in the sequence, before the effects that cause difficulties. This allows the system to process some of the effect frames before displaying them, decreasing the chance of playback difficulties.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you still experience dropped frames, open your project's Video Display settings and set a Video Pre-Fill amount of a few seconds. This preloads the specified amount of video and can help if the system has trouble maintaining real-time playback.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some BCC AVX RT effects can play in real time with Real-time Effect Quality set to High Quality within the Video Display Settings. Experiment with combinations of the Real-time Effect Quality and Pre-Filled Frames settings to find the settings that best suit your project and workflow.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some aspects of BCC AVX RT effects appear a bit different during real-time preview than non-real-time preview and final render to disk. This is particularly true of effects using geometric distortions (Scale, Tumble, Spin, Rotate) and effects that blur and
  </p>
  <p>
   choke edges. While finetuning these parameters, it is recommended to toggle to non- real-time mode to check the quality of the final render. To do this, click the green dot in the Timeline and step to another frame or change a parameter to force the Composer window to update. In non-real-time mode you can also check the output on an external (NTSC or PAL) monitor.

   Compatibility with Older Versions of BCC AVX
  </p>
  <p>
   When you install BCC AVX Version 4.1, it does not overwrite any older versions of BCC AVX. Both versions can coexist in your Avid.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, new presets do not overwrite any existing preset folders. The BCC AVX 4.1 presets are installed in a different path (see below) than the previous version to avoid problems. If you have created custom presets, you can move the older presets so that they will appear in the new filters Preset menu. There are some limitations to this procedure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Effects templates from earlier versions of BCC AVX that you saved in a bin are not compatible with BCC AVX version 4.1. The workaround to this Avid limitation is to apply the effects, promote the effects, then save the new version to a bin. For more information, see 11Working with Presets" in Chapter 1 in the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p>
   After you save the presets, copy them into the new BCC AVX location, as described below.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can keep both AVX 1.5 and AVX 2.0 versions on your system. This allows you to promote existing BCC AVX 1.5 effects to AVX 2.0. However, if you do this, the AVX 1.5 filters will appear in categories named
   <i>
    <b>
     BCC3Category
    </b>
   </i>
   <i>
    <b>
     Name
    </b>
   </i>
   . The new filters will appear in a category named
   <i>
    <b>
     BCCCategoryName
    </b>
   </i>
   . Only the new filters will appear in this category.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, the AVX 1.5 Color &amp; Blurs filters appear in the
   <i>
    <b>
     BCC3Colors&amp;Blurs
    </b>
   </i>
   category, while
   <i>
    <b>
     BCCColors&amp;Blurs
    </b>
   </i>
   only includes the new BCC Color Match and BCC Median filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   For details on promoting effects, see your Avid documentation. You must have both the AVX 1.5 and AVX 2.0 versions on your system to promote effects.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Copying Presets from Earlier Versions to BCC AVX Version 4.1
  </p>
  <p>
   To use presets created in earlier versions of BCC AVX, you need to copy the older presets from their previous preset location to the new BCC AVX 4.1 preset folder location.

   Applying and Rendering BCC AVX Filters and Transitions
  </p>
  <p>
   Once Boris Continuum Complete AVX is installed, the effects automatically appear in the Effects Palette. The Boris Continuum Complete filters are arranged alphabetically, by category in the Effects Palette.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Applying BCC Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   Some effects can be applied as either a transition or a filter. If an effect can be applied as a transition, it appears in the BCC Two-Input Effects category. For example, to apply a Pyramid Blur as a filter, choose BCC Pyramid Blur from the BCC Color &amp; Blurs category. However, to apply a Pyramid Blur as a transition, you would choose BCC TR Pyramid Blur from the BCC Two-Input Effects category. For more information on transitions, see 11Applying BCC Effects as Transitions" on page 12.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can also apply BCC effects to titles created in the Avid Title tool or to imported mattes. For more information, see 11Applying BCC Effects to Titles" in Chapter 1 of your User Guide.

   Applying BCC Effects as Transitions
  </p>
  <p>
   BCC provides two methods to use effects as transitions. The first method is to apply a BCC Two-Input effect to the transition between two clips. The second method is to overlap two clips and apply a BCC filter effect to each layer. Each method offers advantages.
  </p>
  <p>
   BCC Two-Input effects offer the convenience of an Avid transition. For example, trimming and duration changes are easily made and you only have to render a single effect. However, to create a wider range of transition effects, you can use the second method: overlap two clips and apply a filter to each layer. This method provides greater control over parameters. For details, see 11Applying BCC Effects as Transitions" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Applying BCC Effects to Titles and Mattes
  </p>
  <p>
   To apply a BCC effect to a title or to an imported matte, drag the effect onto the title. If you Option-drag to the effect, the effect is applied to the title as well as to any tracks beneath the title in the timeline. For example, to apply a Pyramid Blur to a title, drag the BCC Pyramid Blur effect onto the title. To apply a Pyramid Blur to a title and the background video, Option-drag the BCC Pyramid Blur effect to the title. For detailed information, see 11Applying BCC Effects to Titles and Mattes" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Applying Multiple Filters to Avid Titles and Mattes
  </p>
  <p>
   BCC AVX 4.1 allows you to apply two or more effects to an Avid title or matte without affecting the background. For example, you could apply a BCC Emboss to a title and then blur it. The Title Matte parameter group's MultiFilter controls can also be used to apply multiple effects to existing keys, such as chroma keys, without applying them to the entire image. For details, see 11Applying Multiple Filters to Avid Titles and Mattes" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Working with the RT Static Textures Category
  </p>
  <p>
   BCC 4.1 contains a
   <b>
    RT
   </b>
   <b>
    Static
   </b>
   <b>
    Textures
   </b>
   <b>
    category
   </b>
   . This category contains filters that you may want to use as a static background. When you apply these filters, they do not animate, but they will play in real time. See page 4 for the list of BCC RT Static Textures filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can also apply these filters to use clips in the timeline as textures. For example, apply BCC Emboss RT to a clip to create a static backdrop. The frame where the position indicator was when you applied the filter to the clip is used as the static texture; the clip no longer plays back. If you apply a RT Static Textures filter to a clip, make sure you are on the appropriate frame of the clip when you apply the filter.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Rendering Boris Continuum Complete Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   Boris effects render exactly the same as native Avid effects. Render effects individually or render in to out. In addition, if you redigitize material, you simply rerender any effects; all parameters are preserved. For more information, consult your Avid documentation.
  </p>
  <p class="s4">
   Working with OpenGL
  </p>
  <p>
   Boris Continuum Complete's OpenGL hardware acceleration speeds rendering for certain filters in the Lights category. OpenGL is a cross-platform standard that dramatically improves interactivity and rendering. "GL" stands for graphics library. "Open" refers to the ongoing, industry-wide contributions to its evolution. OpenGL is built into both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems as well as a wide variety of display cards. More details about OpenGL are available from
   <a class="a" href="http://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">
    www.opengl.org.
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently Boris Continuum Complete AVX includes several filters that are OpenGL- dependent. These include the BCC Glare, BCC Glint, BCC Glitter, BCC Lens Flare and BCC Lens Flare Advanced filters. OpenGL is required to use these filters. See the Understanding OpenGL PDF on your Boris CD for any additions to this list.
  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   OpenGL Acceleration Requirements
  </p>
  <p>
   The first time you apply any of the Open GL filters, BCC AVX performs a fast, automatic test to look for the specific OpenGL capabilities. If your configuration passes this internal test, the filter opens with OpenGL enabled. If your configuration does not pass, an error message displays in the Composer window and OpenGL is disabled. However, depending on the error message, you may elect to enable OpenGL manually. See the next section for information on working with unsupported systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the most recent list of supported hardware, please see the Understanding OpenGL PDF on your Boris CD.
  </p>
  <p class="s6">
    
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Working with Unsupported Configurations
  </p>
  <p>
   If your system does not pass the OpenGL test, the Composer window displays an error message. Clicking the
   <b>
    OpenGL
   </b>
   <b>
    Prefs
   </b>
   <b>
    checkbox
   </b>
   in the General Controls parameter group displays a dialog box. Click
   <b>
    Yes
   </b>
   to view the results of the internal OpenGL test. This is the recommended method for examining your system's configuration.
  </p>
  <p>
   A window displays information about your system, including the graphics card, OpenGL version, driver, texture memory and OS version. Two types of error messages can display in this window. The first type of message indicates an unsupported configuration. In this case, you can try manually enabling OpenGL by selecting the
   <b>
    Enabled
   </b>
   <b>
    checkbox
   </b>
   in the dialog box. In many instances, unsupported hardware can correctly render the OpenGL filters. If you enable this option and your system displays distorted frames, you will not be able to use the OpenGL filters. The second type of error is a critical error. In this case, you cannot manually enable OpenGL and you will not be able to use the OpenGL filters. When you finish with the OpenGL dialog box, click
   <b>
    OK
   </b>
   to close the window.

   Working with Presets and Effect Templates
  </p>
  <p>
   After you apply and adjust a BCC AVX filter, you can save the parameter settings by pressing the
   <b>
    Preset
   </b>
   <b>
    menu
   </b>
   and choosing
   <i>
    <b>
     Save
    </b>
   </i>
   . A dialog box allows you to name and save the file. Presets are only compatible with the filter in which they were created. For example, if you attempt to load a Cartooner preset into a Blur filter, the preset is ignored. However, you can also save PixelChooser parameters as presets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boris Continuum Complete AVX includes a selection of preset effects for each filter. These presets are an excellent way to learn the capabilities of a filter. For more information, see 11Working with Presets" in Chapter 1 in the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Resetting Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   The Preset menu allows you to save filter settings independently of the media or project. You can return to the Boris Continuum Complete default settings or to a custom default that you create yourself. For more information, see 11Resetting Effects" and 11Creating Custom Default Settings" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Loading Preset Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   To load a previously saved filter settings file, you must first apply the same filter to your media. A list of existing presets also appears in the menu. For more information, see 11Loading Preset Effects" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Saving Effects as Presets
  </p>
  <p>
   You can save favorite filter settings as presets and apply them to multiple projects. Presets are static; all parameter values in the first keyframe are applied. For detailed information on saved presets, see 11Saving Effects as Presets" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s9">
   Saving Effect Templates in a Bin
  </p>
  <p>
   You can save parameter settings in a bin as an Effect template, just as you save other Avid effects. Effect templates allow you to save effect parameters and use them again to create or modify other effects. While parameter settings saved in the Preset menu are static, Effect templates save parameters set at multiple keyframes. For detailed information on saving effect templates, see 11Saving Effect Templates in a Bin" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   Applying Effect Templates from a Bin

  <p class="s9">
   Saving BCC AVX Effects as Custom Transitions
  </p>
  <p>
   You can now save custom transitions to the Avid Quick Transition menu for easy access. This means that custom BCC AVX transitions appear in the Quick Transitions dialog box. For details, see 11Saving BCC Effects as Custom Transitions" in Chapter 1 of the User Guide.

  <p class="s4">
   Known Limitations
  </p>
  <p>
   BCC AVX 4.1 contains the following limitations.
  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   General Limitations
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you apply an effect to the timeline on top of another filter (to replace it), you may get an error message saying the 11Effect does not Apply." This is because the new effect has a different number of inputs than the one you are replacing. Manually remove the first effect, then apply the second effect to the clip instead.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you add a large number of presets to a filter (for example, more than 25), the filter's preset menu will draw slowly when you click it.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you step field by field through the DeInterlace filter, you will see a luma shift and softening on each of the even fields. This is due to the way Avid's previews are displayed and does not affect final render.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   BCC AVX RT (Real-Time) effects will look incorrect when previewed in non-realtime (blue dot) mode. They will appear correct in realtime (green dot) mode and when you render them to disk.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you apply a BCC AVX Two Input filter between two clips on the timeline, then apply a BCC AVX filter to one of the clips included in the transition, you may crash entering Effects mode if the transition effect overlaps the clip effect.
  </p>
  <p class="s6">
    
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you are creating a Custom PixelChooser region for an effect in the timeline, and you click back and forth between another effect in Effects mode, you may run into a situation where the custom shape that is part of the other effect displays and you are unable to draw custom PixelChooser regions for either effect. Exit and re-enter Effects mode in order to display the effects correctly.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The Light Zoom filter appears squeezed slightly horizontally when the Fields menu is set to Speed Optimized. Set the Fields menu to Quality Optimized before rendering.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you load a Colorize group preset into a rendered Light Rays filter, in some cases the position of the Light Source is reset to the upper left corner of the frame.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In certain circumstances quitting Avid by using Alt-F4 or by clicking the Close box in the application window, may cause an error message and will not successfully quit. Choose File &gt; Quit to successfully quit the application.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Due to an Avid limitation, if you reposition a dialog box such as the OpenGL test dialog box, or the preset load/save window, you will lose your cursor. If this happens, pressing
   <b>
    Enter
   </b>
   to close the dialog window will cause a crash.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Applying an effect to a title is a destructive process that replaces the Avid title effect in the timeline. To edit the title as text (for example, change text characters, font, or layout), you need to save another copy of the title effect in a bin. Removing the effect will also remove the title.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   A black line appears where the seam would be when the BCC Sphere, BCC Cylinder, BCC DVE, BCC DVE Basic, and BCC Z Space filters are applied to Avid titles. Use the Crop controls in these filters to crop out the line if necessary.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   To render a filter applied to filler, at least one frame of real source media must overlap somewhere on a lower track in the Avid timeline. Otherwise the effect will preview, but the following error message displays when you try to render; 11There is no source media for this effect. Filler can't be used as a source." In addition, if you apply a RT Static Textures to filler with no media on lower tracks, you may crash.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Occasionally when you change a rendered effect, the effect does not display as unrendered until you move the position indicator. For example, you render an effect in Effect mode. If you then move the position indicator in the Effect Preview monitor to another time and make a change, the effect doesn't display as unrendered until you move the position indicator again.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   You are unable to display Avid's Grid overlay over BCC AVX filters that include PixelChooser parameters. The grid overlay appears for a second and then disappears.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   You may find it difficult to type numeric values for slider parameters that allow decimal point values. This is an Avid limitation, but you will have the best results dragging the slider as close as you can, then using Shift -Right/Left Arrow and Right/Left Arrow to enter the precise value. The Arrow keys move by a factor of 1; Shift-Arrow moves by a factor of 10.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The first frame in a 3D Image Shatter effect will be partially shattered if
   <b>
    Shatter
   </b>
   is set to
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    <b>
     Shredded
    </b>
   </i>
   . To fix this, edit the effect against a short, unaffected section of the same clip.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you reverse the speed in the 3D Image Shatter or 2D Particles filters, the effect does not completely finish. The last frame of the effect shows the image partly shattered.
  </p>

 <li>
  <p>
   When you apply a BCC AVX Two Input effect and enable the
   <b>
    Bypass
   </b>
   <b>

   </b>
   in the General Controls, the effect will display the outgoing shot for the full duration of the effect instead of switching from the outgoing to the incoming clip.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Selecting the
   <b>
    Bypass
   </b>
   <b>
    checkbox
   </b>
   in an already rendered effect will unrender the effect. If you use the Undo command or press Control-Z (Windows), the effect becomes rendered again.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Saving a preset through a rendered effect will unrender the effect. If you use the Undo command or press Control-Z (Windows), the effect becomes rendered again.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The AVX architecture does not support contextual controls, so parameters that do not apply are not dimmed or grayed out in the Effect Editor. This means that a parameter that appears in the Effect Editor may not apply unless other parameters are met. For example, the
   <b>
    Reverse
   </b>
   <b>
    Range
   </b>
   parameter in the PixelChooser Region parameter group does not have any affect unless specific shapes are selected in the PixelChooser Region Type menu. This may be confusing at times and you may need to consult the documentation if you are not familiar with the controls that are conditional. Whenever possible, parameters that are inactive unless certain conditions are met have been noted in the documentation.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In the BCC Film Damage and BCC Film Grain filters, the PixelChooser Intensity control may appear stretched at certain values.

  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   Motion Key Limitations
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Not all imagery is appropriate for the Motion Key filter. For example, images with large uniform textures, like fields of grain, sky, water, or blank walls will not work well with this filter. Images with lots of motion blur or low contrast images may also cause problems. In addition, perspective shifts (for example, a forward dolly shot) or moving foreground objects that dominate the image will not generate optimum results. For best results, your target region should include a fair amount of contrast with good vertical and horizontal edge definition as well as large areas of non-uniform detail, especially edges in various directions. The motion of the clip should only include panning, zooming and rotation. Large background areas with objects moving independent of the background are also suitable.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   At this time, the Motion Key filter works best with progressive footage. This limitation will be corrected in a future release. If you are not working with progressive footage, you can use one of two workarounds if you encounter problems. First, you could apply
  </p>
  <p>
   the BCC Deinterlace filter and render the clip before applying the Motion Key filter. Second, you could create a 100% Avid motion effect and set the

   The Motion Key requires full resolution images to track accurately. Therefore, systems that include Adrenaline or Mojo hardware can expect more accurate results.

   Motion Tracking Limitations
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you work with the Motion Tracker parameter groups or the BCC Witness Protection or Corner Pin filters, you should work at the highest quality and resolution possible. In general, systems that include Mojo or Adrenaline hardware can expect more accurate tracking results since Avid passes BCC AVX a full resolution image.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Although some real-time filters may include the Motion Tracker parameter groups, you should not use the real-time version of a filter to motion track. Use the non-real-time version.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you work with the motion tracker parameters, if you add a keyframe on the second field of a frame, the tracker region may appear to be in the wrong location. This will not affect the tracking. If you advance the Position Indicator to the next field, the tracker region appears in the correct location. If possible, always place motion tracker keyframes on the first field. Avid indicates the second field with the suffix
   <i>
    <b>
     .2
    </b>
   </i>
   in the timecode display.
  </p>
  <p>
   When using the Rewind key to get to the head of a clip, the clip's end keyframe is deselected. Make sure the end keyframe is selected before attempting to use motion tracking.
  </p>
  <p class="s7">
   Optical Stabilizer Limitations
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Unlike Avid's Region Stabilize effect which only takes horizontal and vertical movement into consideration, the BCC Optical Stabilizer allows you to take motion, rotation and scaling into account when stabilizing. However, because it uses optical flow technology, the BCC Optical Stabilizer is more render intensive than the Region Stabilize effect and may not be appropriate for all clips.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Not all imagery is appropriate for optical stabilization. For example, images with large uniform textures, like fields of grain, sky, water, or blank walls will not work well with this filter. Images with lots of motion blur or low contrast images may also cause problems. In addition, perspective shifts (for example, a forward dolly shot) or moving foreground objects that dominate the image will not generate optimum results. For best results, your target region should include a fair amount of contrast with good vertical and horizontal edge definition as well as large areas of non-uniform detail, especially edges in various directions. The motion of the clip should only include panning, zooming and rotation. Large background areas with objects moving independent of the background are also suitable.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When working with the Optical Stabilizer, you should make the target area as large as possible, unless the image contains untrackable areas of uniform texture, such as sky or water.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   At this time, the Optical Stabilizer filter works best with progressive footage. This limitation will be corrected in a future release. If you are not working with progressive footage, you can use one of two workarounds if you encounter problems. First, you could apply the BCC Deinterlace filter and render the clip before applying the Motion Key filter. Second, you could create a 100% speed Avid motion effect and set the

   Working with the PixelChooser’s Motion Tracker
  </p>
  <p>
   The Motion Tracker parameter group is included in many filters that include the PixelChooser parameter group. This allows you to apply the filter to an area using a shape choice in the PC Region parameter group's Shape menu.

   In filters that include the PixelChooser, choosing
   <i>
