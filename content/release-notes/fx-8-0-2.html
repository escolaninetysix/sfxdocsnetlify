 Important Note on OpenGL Support
 <a name="bookmark28">
 </a>
 ‌
</p>
<p>
 Due to the fast rate at which OpenGL card manufacturers release drivers, FX may disqualify your OpenGL hardware erroneously. If this happens, you should try to enable OpenGL to see if you benefit from OpenGL acceleration. If you have troubles with slowness, or render inconsistencies, please disable OpenGL. 
</p>
<p>
 While OpenGL may work in the FX KeyFramer, that does not necessarily mean it will work inside your host application. This is due to the fact that some hosts use OpenGL memory, leaving it unavailable for FX when you work inside the host.
</p>
<p>
 If your host crashes when trying to apply FX, and you cannot disable OpenGL in your host, please contact our technical support staff. They will send you a preferences file that will start Boris FX with OpenGL disabled.
</p>
<p>
 BorisFX will make every effort to continue to qualify OpenGL cards and driver versions. However, it is important to note that it is impossible to qualify all combinations of OpenGL cards, operating system, drivers and host applications. In general you should run the latest driver available for your OpenGL card. If you have problems with the latest driver, visit the Boris website to see a list of the latest supported driver versions.

 Supported OpenGL Hardware
 <a name="bookmark29">
 </a>
 ‌
</p>
<p>
 OpenGL is a cross-platform standard that accelerates the rendering of 2D and 3D graphics. Most newer video cards have hardware-based OpenGL acceleration. If your system does not include the recommended minimum requirements, FX initially defaults OpenGL to Off. You can re-enable OpenGL in the FX Preferences window. You can still use FX without OpenGL or with an older card, you just won’t gain as much acceleration while working. For details on how to use OpenGL, see the FX User Guide.
</p>
<p>
 Final Cut Pro 4.x users must have a minimum of Macintosh OS 10.3 installed to support FX’s OpenGL feature.

   Checking your OpenGL Hardware, Software, Drivers and Settings
  </p>
  <p>
   The first time you launch Boris FX, an internal test is run on your system to determine whether your hardware meets the minimum requirements necessary for OpenGL Hardware acceleration. If your hardware does not meet the minimum requirements, OpenGL is disabled by default on your system.
  </p>
  <p>
   To perform the OpenGL Hardware test manually, click the
   <b>
    Test OpenGL Hardware button
   </b>
   in the Preferences window’s Render tab.
  </p>
  <p>
   This test may take a few seconds. After the test is run, a window displays specifics of the hardware and drivers on your system. If any results show your system may have problems running OpenGL, this window details the errors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The test stresses your OpenGL hardware, so you should run the test with a typical workload. Before you run the OpenGL hardware test, launch any applications that you usually run while you edit (any graphics intensive applications you are running at the time may affect the results).
  </p>
  <p>
   If you want, click the
   <b>
    Copy to Clipboard button
   </b>
   to copy this information to your system clipboard. This allows you to print or email this information. When you finish, click
   <b>
    OK
   </b>
   to close this window.
  </p>
  <p>
   FX uses the following guidelines for optimal OpenGL performance. Some of this information does not affect FX’s hardware testing but is useful for technical support if you are having OpenGL problems:
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
 
   OpenGL version--Should be 1.2 and higher.

 </li>
 <li>
 
   Driver Version--As a general rule, you should install and run the latest driver available for your GL card. ATI users should not use driver versions previous to 63.68. NVidia users should not use driver versions previous to 65.00.

 </li>
 <li>

   Texture Rectangle--This is an advanced OpenGL image sizing feature. If you are having OpenGL problems, this provides useful information for technical support.
 
 </li>
 <li>
  
   Texture Memory-- Texture Memory displays the amount of memory on the video card available for FX to use for textures (layer images).To use FX without display or performance problems, Texture Memory must be at least 32MB. Texture Memory available is not the absolute of memory on your card, but rather the amount available to FX.

 </li>
 <li>

   Texture Dimension displays the maximum texture size that can be used with the video card.
 
 </li>
 <li>

   Macintosh OS Version displays the installed version of the Macintosh OS (if you are running on a Macintosh system.) Macintosh users must have at least Macintosh OS

  <p>
   10.2.6 installed to support OpenGL; Final Cut Pro 4.x users, must have at least Macintosh OS 10.3 installed to support OpenGL.
  </p>
  <p class="s4">
   <a name="bookmark18">
   </a>
   OpenGL Errors
  </p>
  <p>
   When the OpenGL Hardware Test is run, error messages may display if your system fails. These errors display as Hardware Status errors or Critical Testing errors.
  </p>

   Hardware Status errors report the status of your current system setup against FX’s recommended card manufacturer, model and driver. These errors do not prevent you from using OpenGL, they just warn that your specific setup may cause problems with OpenGL. Hardware Status errors can include messages such as insufficient texture memory or reports that your card was not recognized by FX’s internal hardware testing. When you receive a Hardware Status error, OpenGL is automatically disabled when you launch FX. However, you can manually enable OpenGL in the FX Preferences window.

  <p>
   <b>
    Critical Testing errors
   </b>
   report errors that will
   <u>
    not
   </u>
   allow you to use OpenGL in FX. When you receive a Critical Testing error, OpenGL is automatically disabled when you launch FX. If you receive a Critical Testing error, you should not enable OpenGL or you may crash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Final Cut Pro 4.x users must have at least Macintosh OS version 10.3 installed in order to support FX’s OpenGL feature.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certain errors are influenced by your video card’s display properties, which are card-driver specific. As a general rule, set the display properties to 32 bits of color, with the depth buffer set to at least 16 bits. On many cards OpenGL capabilities are reduced for higher display resolution and refresh rates.

   Troubleshooting OpenGL Issues
  </p>
  <p>
   To toggle OpenGL off, use the keyboard shortcut Command or Control-[. To turn it back on, the keyboard shortcut Command-] (Macintosh) or Control-] (Windows). Menu choices also appear in the Preview menu and in the Preferences window. You can still use FX without OpenGL or with an older card, you just won’t gain as much acceleration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Display problems such as white, rainbow or garbage images in the Composite window may be related to OpenGL. If this occurs, open the Preference window. In the Render tab, change the
   <b>
    OpenGL Acceleration menu
   </b>
   to use less texture caching. Texture caching is used for textures (layer images) and is related to the amount of Texture memory on the video card. Display problems related to OpenGL will not affect your rendered effects.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you experience OpenGL problems, setting the
   <b>
    OpenGL Acceleration menu
   </b>
   to use less texture caching improves OpenGL reliability, but lessens performance.

   Supported Preview to Monitor Hardware
   <a name="bookmark31">
   </a>
   ‌
  </p>
  <p>
   You can output video to an external monitor through a FireWire converter box or through supported video hardware connected to your system. You can output media at any project size and immediately view your working frame without rendering the timeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some hosts have native Preview to Monitor (PTM) where FX passes a frame and the host displays it. If a host has this ability, for example Meridien-based Avid systems, then nothing changes from the FX 2.x capabilities. However, if a host did not have native PTM ability, then you can use the new Preview to Monitor feature. The user does not have hardware choices in the Preferences window if FX uses native host PTM (since the host controls the hardware connection).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   As a plugin, FX does not officially support connecting to hardware that is already in use by the host NLE for direct Video Out purposes. The plug-in version of FX can only use the FireWire output if the NLE releases it while FX is running. A number of hosts (for example Premiere and FCP) will not release control of the primary display hardware. This prevents FX's Preview to Monitor feature from working until the NLE releases control of the FireWire hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, FX looks for all possible output devices upon installation, and lists the results in the Device menu in the Preview tab of the Boris FX preferences. As a result, users may be able to use a different output device for FX than the one that the host application uses. The host application may use its own capture hardware for display, leaving the FireWire port available.
  </p>
  <p>
   Video-out capabilities are also available in the standalone Boris FX KeyFramer. This enables anyone with supported video hardware, whether built into their computers, included with their NLEs, or provided through third parties, to see the work they create in Boris FX immediately on television monitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   FX supports the following video cards for the new Preview to Monitor (PTM) feature in both the FX KeyFramer and while using FX in your host. For detailed information on the new PTM feature, see the FX User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s19">
   Make sure you have the latest drivers installed for the supported video cards.

     </a>
     Stacking Multiple Overlapping Boris Effects
    </p>
    <p>
     We do not recommend adding multiple FX effects to an Edius clip or stacking clips containing Boris effects on multiple layers in the Edius timeline. This may work, but depending on your system specifics, multiple Boris effects (&gt;2) on a clip or stacked on top of each other may not render properly. Instead, apply a single FX effect to an Edius clip and add multiple filters to the clip within FX
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     This limitation only applies to effects that overlap exactly. For example, a track containing both an in and an out transition would not fall under this suggestion (since they can not overlap).

     If there is more than one Boris effect applied to a clip, the effect of preceding filters will not display in the subsequent filters in the FX User Interface. For example, if first a blur filter and then a ripple filter are applied to the same Edius clip, the blur filter effect will not show in the effected track when the ripple effect is launched. However, all effects will display during render in the Edius Preview window.

     Important Information for Final Cut Pro Users
     <a name="bookmark54">
     </a>
     ‌
    </p>
    <p>
     Final Cut Pro 4.x users must have at least Macintosh OS version 10.3 installed in order to support FX’s OpenGL feature.
    </p>
    <p>
     To use FX’s Preview to Monitor feature, you must turn off the external video in Final Cut Pro before launching FX. Choose View &gt; External Video &gt; Off before launching FX, then enable FX’s Preview to Monitor feature when FX is launched. After leaving FX, reenable the external video (View &gt; External Video &gt; All Frames) to see Final Cut Pro video in the external monitor.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Final Cut Pro 3 users with FireWire for FX's Preview to Monitor feature, must disconnect before clicking the
     <b>
      Apply button
     </b>
     or FCP will crash. To disconnect, choose
     <i>
      <b>
       Preview &gt; Disconnect External Monitor
      </b>
     </i>
     .
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Final Cut Pro 4.x users can now use FX as a transition, taking advantage of a new architecture jointly developed between Boris FX and Apple. See Appendix B in the FX User Guide for information on applying Boris FX as a transition.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     FX will now correctly field render video in the wells when using an FCP Generator. However, the media placed in the input wells for a FX Generator should match the FCP sequence size. Both the FX project size and the size of the well video will appear in FX at the FCP sequence size. If the well media is not the same as the FCP sequence size, fields won't render correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Additionally, any video put into the input wells of a FX filter should be the same size as the clip with FX applied. In the case of FX applied as a filter, the FX project size is determined by the size of the filtered media. Once again the size of the filtered media needs to match any video in the wells. This will maintain the integrity of fields since FX doesn't allow host video inputs of various sizes within the same effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     To use media whose size doesn’t match the FCP sequence size (Generator) or the Filter media size, the best approach is to import that media directly into the Boris timeline from disk (rather than from the wells in FCP). This will provide you with full flexibility for dealing with non-standard size images, field interpretation, and oversize images.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     To edit an existing FX effect, make sure the playhead is positioned on the effect you want to edit before launching FX. Otherwise, the Boris interface will not appear.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Do not export from Boris FX unless the FCP resolution is set to 100%. Otherwise, you get reduced image quality, because FCP does not provide FX with full-size frames. Likewise, if Final Cut Pro is at less than full resolution (100%), previews at full size appear in reduced quality.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     In some instances the FX plug-in crashes due to an apparent conflict with MacsBug v6.6.3. If you have MacsBug 6.6.3 installed and experience crashing, try disabling or running an earlier version of MacsBug when using FX.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you apply FX as a filter of generator, FX gets the project size from the media size and the Final Cut Pro project size. However, this is NOT how the FX transition works.The FX transition determines its project size by multiplying the Canvas window view percentage times the Final Cut Pro Project size. You should set the Canvas window to 100% before applying FX as a transition.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, you are using a 720x480 Final Cut Pro project. You apply FX to the transition between two clips, but are viewing your Canvas window at 50%. When you launch FX, the Project and media size is 260x240 (720x480 multiplied by .5). When viewing your Canvas window at 50%. with Square Pixels enabled, FX would set your project size to 360x270 (720X540 multiplied by .5). However, when you apply FX, the media displays at its correct size. If you view the Canvas window at 100% or larger, FX displays the media at its correct size.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     If more than one version of FX is installed in Final Cut Pro, the Effects menu lists both versions with the same name: Boris FX. The top item in the list is Boris FX 8.0.2 and the second item is the earlier version. We recommend you uninstall earlier versions.

     If you have more than 900 filters, you will not see some filters inside Boris FX. If you reach the filter limit, when you launch Boris FX a warning asks you to remove some files from the BorisPlugins folder. You can ignore the warning and continue to work. However, you will not have access to all filters inside the BorisPlugins folder. You can use the Plugin Filter Manager to hide the filters you don’t need. See the User Guide for details on using the Plugin Filter Manager.

     Important Information about Working with Motion Filters
     <a name="bookmark69">
     </a>
     ‌
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     You should use the Snap CTI to KeyFrame option (Track &gt; Snap CTI to KeyFrame) when working with the Motion filters to avoid confusion. For example, this option is not selected and you move the CTI off a selected keyframe. Then you adjust the Search and Target parameters using on-screen controls. A new keyframe is not created. Instead, the selected keyframe is adjusted. This could cause your media to track incorrectly. If you want to create a new keyframe, you must deselect all keyframes before adjusting parameters on-screen.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     While Interpolation Fields appear next to the Search/Target tab parameters, you should not adjust the Interpolation. Leave the Interpolation set to Hold. Adjusting the Interpolation will not affect the tracking but may cause on-screen parameters to display incorrectly.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     You can work at Half or Quarter Resolution to achieve a preview of a motion filter. But if the motion tracker fails repeatedly, you may have to work at Full Resolution.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     You can only adjust the Search and Target regions in the Motion filter track's Preview window. The Source track does not display the region controls; the Composite window does not display the region controls.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The field order of the media must match the field order setting in the Media tab. You can set this in the Import tab in the Preferences window. See the FX User Guide for more information.

     Important Information Using the KeyFrame Library

     </a>
     ‌
    </p>
    <p>
     The first time you browse the KeyFrame Library effects within the Library Browser you must generate thumbnail images for the effects.

       . For more information on using the KeyFrame Library, see the FX User Guide.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     We recommend that you build thumbnail previews for the KeyFrame Library in the FX KeyFramer rather than within your host application. Because building previews actually renders your effect, this process can take as much as 25-30% longer in the plug-in than in the FX KeyFramer.

     Fixed Bugs in Boris FX since Version 8.0
     <a name="bookmark73">
     </a>
     ‌
    </p>
    <p>
     FX 8.0.2 includes many bug fixes from the initial version 8 release of FX. Fixed bugs include the following. Some of the following bugs were fixed in earlier versions of FX.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     FX now correctly supports Macintosh OS X 10.4.2 (Tiger).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     FX 8.0.2 settings now correctly open in Red 3.0.4.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p class="s16">
   Avid only: FX now correctly installs into Avid Xpress Pro 4.8 and Adrenaline 1.8 systems.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   An issue with QuickTime export movies has been fixed, which previously caused a crash in certain hosts plug-ins (primarily on Windows AVX hosts). This crash could also occur when selecting the QT codec.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p class="s16">
   Final Cut Pro users only: FX now correctly field renders synthetic media (gradients and splines) when you apply as a generator. However, this fix will not work for legacy projects from FCP version 3.0. A previous version fixed a related problem so that other media types would field render video in the wells when using an FCP Generator. However, the media placed in the input wells for a Generator should match the FCP sequence size. Both the FX project size and the size of the well video will appear in FX at the FCP sequence size. If the well media is not the same as the FCP sequence size, fields won't render correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, any video in the input wells should be the same size as the filtered clip. When applied as a filter, the FX project size is determined by the size of the filtered media which needs to match any video in the wells. This will maintain the integrity of fields since FX doesn't allow host video inputs of various sizes within the same effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a case that requires media sources whose size will not match the FCP sequence size (Generator) or the filter media size, the best approach is to import that media into the FX timeline from disk (rather than from the wells in FCP). This provides flexibility for dealing with non-standard size images, field interpretation, and oversize images.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In earlier versions, the Preview To Monitor for Avid feature was disabled even when running in Meridien-based Avid versions. This is now corrected.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p class="s16">
   Final Cut Pro 4.0 only: The FX banner in the Effect Control tab no longer disappears after you apply an effect.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p class="s16">
   Final Cut Pro 4.0 only: In earlier versions, FX could crash when applied as a filter or static generator in a setup that included a custom screen layout, such as color correction. This problem would occur when relaunching the FX user interface. This problem has been corrected.

  <ul id="l8">
   <li>
    <p>
     If you tumble an object that has an image bump map (such as a movie or still image file), you may see a moire pattern as it tumbles.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you save a style to the Materials tab in the Style Palette, it does not correctly save the Source type that was used in the Bump Map tab.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you open settings created in previous versions of FX, FX 8.0.2 ignores controls that were initially enabled in the Lights 2 and 3 tabs.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you search for a missing media file using the
     <b>
      Search button
     </b>
     in the Media Files window, it may not find files that were moved to another local drive. Manually browse to the new location of the file and press the
     <b>
      Replace button
     </b>
     .
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Tracks containing PSD files that are converted to containers do not correctly update if you modify them (for example in Photoshop) and then use the Reload Files command.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you choose
     <i>
      <b>
       Targa Sequence

     </i>
     as a file type when exporting a movie file, clicking the
     <b>
      Compression Settings button
     </b>
     erroneously displays QuickTime codec selections.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     If you use the Keyframe Time field in the timeline to move keyframes, all keyframes that a moving keyframe passes are merged to it. Instead, move keyframes past one another by dragging the mouse.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Photoshop (.psd) files with adjustment layers display incorrectly in FX if you convert their track to a container. Turn off any adjustment layers in Photoshop before importing
    </p>
    <p>
     .psd files if you plan on converting them to containers.

   <li>
    <p>
     Previewing with audio while you Preview to RAM to Monitor will disconnect Preview to an external monitor.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Audio waveforms do not update when you adjust the global timeline. This is only a display issue and can be corrected by moving something slightly in the Composite window.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Resuming a partial render of an exported QuickTime file may have some undesirable results. In particular, video compressed with codecs that use frame-differencing and data-rate-limiting (such as Sorenson or Cinepak) may exhibit the following behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some frames following the resume point may be corrupted. The data rate may be slightly larger than expected. Also, if the file includes an audio track, a slight blip may be heard at the resume point. This may occur with any codec.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     If you use Frame-Differenced movies (including movies compressed with Apple’s QuickTime Animation codec and some movies compressed with Sorenson), you will see reduced performance. The use of Frame-Differenced movies is not recommended within FX.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When host field media is exported or previewed as frames, only the first field is used.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When an image is full size in the Composite window, you must deselect the Shape control in the Composite window’s Controls menu to directly manipulate an object’s Mask or Crop controls.

   Limitations with Avid Systems Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Avid 24p media renders with an image quality problem that seems to indicate FX is treating it as fielded media. We are working with Avid to quickly correct this problem.

   Limitations with Edius Systems Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In Edius, when a clip is rendered, that clip is locked. Any changes to a FX effect will not display in the Edius Preview window until Edius is closed and reopened. To work around this limitation, complete the following steps:

   Create the transition in FX as if your clips are correct. When you finish, apply the effect to Liquid and render your transition. The final render will be correct.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alternatively you can press the
   <b>
    Media icon
   </b>
   in each FX track and swap Video 1 and Video 2. When you create your transition it will look correct in FX. Remember to swap them back before applying to Liquid.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When FX is applied to a segment that also has a transition (including a native Liquid Transition) applied, the effect previews correctly, but renders as if the effect was applied twice (once on the video segment and again during the duration of the transition).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Although choices appear for accessing video tracks 1 - 32, you can only successfully access tracks 1 and 2. Tracks higher than two display as black. This is a limitation of the Pinnacle plug-in architecture.

 <li>
  <p class="s16">
   Pinnacle Liquid Edition 6.1 only: Due to changes made in the Liquid Edition plug-in architecture in version 6.1, you must manually set the FX project size to match your Pinnacle Liquid Edition project size.

   Limitations with Sony Vegas Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you create an effect in FX that will output an alpha channel to Vegas (for example a picture-in-picture which does not include the background video), when you apply the effect back to the vegas timeline you will notice the edges appear rough and contain white fringes. You need to reenter FX on the effect and in the FX Preferences set the Local Preferences’
   <b>
    Alpha Type menu
   </b>
   to
   <i>
    <b>
     Premultiplied with Black
    </b>
   </i>
   . The effect will display correctly when you apply back to Vegas. You will need to do this every time you create an effect that outputs alpha.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If a Boris effect is prerendered in the Vegas timeline, future changes to that effect in Boris will be saved but do not appear in the Vegas Preview window until you remove the prerender in Vegas (Tools &gt; Clean up Prerendered Video).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Vegas only previews a single frame of host video in Boris FX. The preview frame is taken from the current position of the Vegas cursor. To preview your effect with updating source media, exit FX and preview the effect in the Vegas Video timeline or import the video directly into the FX timeline.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Motion Blur does not display in a rendered effect if you apply FX directly to a clip in Vegas. Instead, import the media directly into the FX timeline and you will see motion blur after you render your effect.

   Limitations with Ulead Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When using FX as a transition in Ulead, the image quality for host media in the Composite window is very poor. This is because Ulead does not pass a full size image. However, this does not affect rendering. The effect renders in high quality.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When using FX within Ulead with the Matrox Parhelia board, you may run into crashing problems. We do not recommend using the Matrox Parhelia board with FX.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Projects in certain versions of ULead Media Studio Pro may display jagged edges or reversed fields in rendered Boris effects. If your system shows this problem, you can install a registry key that indicates that ULead’s video fields should be reversed.

   Limitations with OpenGL
  </p>
 </li>

   Limitations with Keyboard Shortcuts
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Windows Only: The shortcut for changing color channels to RGB is labelled incorrectly. The Preview menu displays Color Channel as (ALT+-), but the actual shortcut is (ALT+`). You can assign new shortcuts in the Shortcuts window. See the User Guide for more information on creating shortcuts.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Windows Only: The shortcut for hiding marks is listed as (CTRL+ALT+’), however that shortcut does not work. Use the menu choice in the Preview menu, or create your own shortcut in the Keyboard Shortcuts window instead. You can assign new shortcuts in the Shortcuts window. See the User Guide for more information on creating shortcuts.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Windows Only: After creating new keyboard shortcuts, certain Windows menu items may show duplicate keyboard shortcuts (for example, the Filter Palette and Media Files window display the same shortcut). You can assign new shortcuts in the Shortcuts window. See the User Guide for more information on creating shortcuts.

   Limitations with the Spline Object Media Type
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you select a group of splines in the Composite window and adjust one of the Path track’s control parameters, the changes are not applied to any of the splines. The Path controls can only adjust one spline at a time.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The
   <i>
    <b>
     Reverse Keyframes
    </b>
   </i>
   command (Track &gt; Reverse Keyframes) does not work in Spline effects.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you apply a spline style from the Style Palette to a spline primitive shape, the shape resets back to the default shape values.

   Limitations with Filters
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you apply a filter containing the motion tracker then change the duration of the project and analyze the motion, the tracker data will only apply one second’s worth of information, not the new duration that you made. To work around this, after you change the duration, delete the motion tracker filter and apply it again.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When the default interpolation is set to Constant in the Preferences window, and a Motion Tracker filter is added to the timeline, resetting the default interpolation in the Preferences window will result in no keyframes being generated for the Motion Tracker when you move the tracker target/region until you exit and re-enter FX.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Any effect that uses a filter involving edge detection (for example, RGB Edges) should be rendered with the
   <b>
    Better Quality Field Rendering checkbox
   </b>
   selected. Otherwise, the rendered effect will jitter.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In the 2D Particles filters, increasing the particle size scale can cause some custom shapes to truncate. You can avoid this by looking at the initial, unscattered particle grid. If some particles are cut off by the frame when you increase their size, then they will remain cut off throughout the duration of the effect. To avoid this, adjust the size parameters so that no particles are initially cut off.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The first rendered frame of effects using the 2D Particles Advanced filter will display particles, although you will not see particles in the first frame of a preview.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The Fire filter renders with the fields reversed unless you render it with
   <b>
    Better Quality Field Rendering
   </b>
   enabled.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In the Fire filter, when using text as a Map layer, the size of the text is ignored and will frequently display garbage. Map text to a shape, then nest the shape layer inside the Fire filter to correct this problem.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some filters create effects that evolve over time based on their parameter settings. The output of these filters (for example Particle System, Comet) depends on the parameter values for the entire effect; changing a parameter value on any frame changes the output for all subsequent frames. If you see a jump in the animation after changing a parameter, the jump is probably because FX did not invalidate frames that were affected by the change. You can fix this by choosing Edit &gt; Purge Frame Cache, and previewing again. Your rendered output does not use the cached frames, so even if you forget to purge the frame cache, your final render appears correctly.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The Motion Tracker Filter’s
   <b>
    Analyze button
   </b>
   won’t analyze the total length of the timeline if a movie file’s length is shorter than the duration of the effect and the movie file is set to Loop.
