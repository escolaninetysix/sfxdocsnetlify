<p><strong style="line-height: 1.4;">BCC 9.0.2 for DaVinci Resolve - Known Issues and Limitations </strong><span style="line-height: 1.4;"> :</span></p>
<ul>
<li>26750 - The Beat Reactor audio graph becomes less accurate as the Frequency Resolution is increased to high values. Use lower values near the default setting of 32 as a workaround.</li>
<li>30360 - Page Turn does not work as when applied as a one sided transitions to the front of a clip.</li>
<li>26796 - BCC Stars will occasionally exhibit horizontal bands of artifacts in the star field and galaxy controls.</li>
<li>26068 - In BCC Particle Emitter 3D, changing the Blend Mode in the Spawn group can unexpectedly affect the main particle compositing.</li>
<li>25867 - In BCC Type On Text the Line Leading in the text entry preview window does not accurately match up with the leading in the rendered result, and the leading may need to be adjusted to generate the desired final render.</li>
<li>29533 - The apply modes Boost Expo 1, 2, and 50/50 mix do not give the expected result in Grunge.</li>
<li>29777 - In Grunge the Edge Offset control in the Chromatic Aberration group is not working as designed.</li>
<li>30613 - Flicker Fixer - When using the Key/Mask controls the intensity of the flicker correction is only half as strong as it should be, even in regions that should be fully corrected.</li>
<li>30351 - Pan and Zoom - Preview Mode rectangle widgets don’t match the final result exactly when using 3D Mode with non-square PAR comps.  Settings which tend to produce more exaggerated 3D perspective will increase the relative amount of difference between the preview widget and the final result.</li>
<li>30395 - Combining 3D Objects filters with other OpenGL accelerated BCC filters such as Lens Flare 3D or Grunge can occasionally cause render errors or instability due to lack of hardware resources depending on host resource use, graphics card capabilities, and BCC 4K preference settings.</li>
<li>28732 - BCC Extruded Text and BCC Type On Text use a custom text entry window and some of the changes that can be made through in this window are not reflected in the preview within the text window on Mac OS (although they will be apparent in the effect when previewed/rendered back in the host). The following text attributes do not preview within the text window:/li&gt;
<ul>
<li>Justification (when Word Wrap is not enabled)</li>
<li>Top Down Text</li>
<li>Right to Left Reading</li>
<li>Negative Line Leading</li>
<li>Italics (for fonts that don't include an italic typeface)</li>
<li>Superscript and Subscript</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>30397 - When using the FX Browser to preview filters in the Transitions category in Resolve, the layer information for the incoming video clip is missing so the result will appear to transition to black instead of to the incoming clip data.</li>
<li>30419 - Changing the preview resolution in the FX Browser to 1:16 and then back to full again will sometimes continue to show lower resolution preview images.</li>
<li>30457 - Perspective filters such as DVE Basic do not show Motion Blur when keyframing geometric properties.</li>
<li>30489 - The UI may not accurately reflect which parameters should be enabled/disabled when an effect is first applied, but toggling any checkbox or menu parameter will force the UI state to refresh and correctly indicate the proper parameter state.</li>
<li>30672 - OFX filters in Resolve are unable to expand the alpha channel boundary of a clip with pre-existing alpha or to stack multiple filters which modify the alpha channel.  This is a universal restriction in Resolve 11 (not specific to BCC) and we are working with the Resolve team to improve the alpha channel pipeline in future versions.</li>
<li>29548 - OFX filters in Resolve do not currently permit accessing information from multiple layers simultaneously.  This is a universal restriction in Resolve 11 (not specific to BCC) and we are working with the Resolve team to improve multi-layer support in future versions.  Due to this limitation some BCC filters which fundamentally rely on access to secondary layers such as Light Wrap do not appear when running in Resolve at this time.  Additionally some BCC effects may contain layer selection parameters which are not currently relevant and should be ignored.</li>
<li>29596 and 30417 - OFX filters in Resolve are not currently able to access layer data from more than +/-5 frames away from the current frame.  This is a universal restriction in Resolve 11 (not specific to BCC) and we are working with the Resolve team to improve time based frame access in future versions. Due to this limitation some BCC filters which fundamentally rely on access to frame information at alternate time such as Optical Stabilizer, Optical Flow, or Velocity Remap do not appear when running in Resolve at this time. Additionally some BCC effects may contain time based parameters which would indicate they can access frames at widely spaced points in time but in reality they will currently be limited to the nearest +/-5 frames.  Additionally the Fx Browser does not have access to frame data to permit preview of effects over moving video and thus the effects will for the time being preview over a static frame when using the Fx Browser in Resolve.</li>
</ul>
