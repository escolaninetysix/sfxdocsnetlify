  <u>
   Fixed Issues:
  </u>
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • All Macintosh/Windows Systems - Projects from RED 4 don’t adjust duration. This is Fixed. However, you need to set RED 5 project’s frame rate to match that of RED 4’s project before opening it.
</p>
<p>
 • Macintosh Systems - RED does not show BCC and FEC filters on a 28+ characters drive. This is Fixed so now the filters show up.
</p>
<p>
 • All Macintosh/Windows Systems - 3 way color wheel feedback in RED is slower than in AE. Fixed, so the performance is at par with how it responds in AE as a plug-in.
</p>
<p>
 • All Macintosh/Windows Systems – In BCC 3 Way Color Grade, Egg shape overlay does not respond when RED is in low resolution. Fixed.
</p>
<p>
 • All Macintosh/Windows Systems – In BCC 3 Way Color Grade, Egg shape does not match the render when in non-square PAR. Fixed.

  Media 100 Suite:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • Cannot deactivate RED serial once you’re in unlicensed Media 100. Fixed, so now you can deactivate the serial number.
