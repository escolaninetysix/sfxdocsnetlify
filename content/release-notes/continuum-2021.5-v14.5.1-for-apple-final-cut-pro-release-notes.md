<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span>

Continuum 2021.5 (v14.5.1) FCP is the first full release of Continuum for FxPlug hosts since Continuum 2020.5 (v13.5.1).  There was a public beta of Continuum 14.0.x, but no official version of 14.0.x was released.  Continuum 2021.5 was completely re-architected to conform to the latest Apple FxPlug specifications, and due to this restructuring public beta projects that used BCC+ filters will not come forward to Continuum 2021.5.  _It is recommended that any projects created with the public beta be finished with the 14.0.3 beta software and then archived._  Continuum 2021.5 includes only the newest 100% GPU accelerated "BCC+" family of filters and no longer installs the older "BCC" filters.  Continuum 2021.5 for FCP does allow side-by-side install with Continuum 2020.5 which makes the original Continuum filters available if desired, although only the newer BCC+ filters will take full advantage of the latest FCP plugin architecture and full GPU pipeline utilization.

**Continuum 2021.5 FCP (v14.5.1) Compatibility Notes:**

* Projects made in the public 14.0.x beta version of Continuum FCP that use BCC+ filters will NOT come forward to the officially shipping version of Continuum 2021.5 due to the architectural restructuring required to support the latest Fxplug SDK.  Projects created with the beta software  should be finished with the beta software and then archived.
* Since Continuum 2021.5 includes only "BCC+" filters.  You need to install Continuum 2020.5 side-by-side with Continuum 2020.5 if you want to access older BCC filters.

**Continuum 2021.5 FCP (v14.5.1) - Known Issues and Limitations:**

* CO-8847 - Mac Installer Registration Dialog fails the installer if certain unicode characters were entered on a previous installer run
* CO-9290 - Licensing - Occasionally the license activation tool does not pop up automatically after installation on Mac.  Re-running the installer should pop up the tool on the next run.
* CO-9331 - Project pane thumbnails sometimes render with tiling artifacts when a BCC+ effect is applied.  This affects only the thumbnails and not the effect results in the timeline.
