 <u>
  <b>
   The following is a listing of the known problems in the product at time of shipping
  </b>
 </u>
 :
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 •
 <b>
  CS5 After Effects
 </b>
 : Projects that have been saved at less than full resolution can cause
 <b>
  BCC 3D Objects
 </b>
 filters to incorrectly render only a portion of the screen. Resaving the project at full resolution and re-rendering solves this problem.
</p>
<p>
 •
 <b>
  CS5 After Effects
 </b>
 : The
 <b>
  BCC Extrude EPS
 </b>
 filter does not maintain its link to the original EPS file
 <u>
  when opening a project in
  <b>
   CS5
  </b>
  that was originated in
  <b>
   CS4
  </b>
 </u>
 . The EPS file must be re-linked manually after opening the project.
</p>
<p>
 •
 <b>
  CS5 After Effects
 </b>
 : The
 <b>
  BCC Extruded Text
 </b>
 filter can sometimes not see certain non-standard fonts
 <u>

  <b>
   CS4
  </b>
 </u>
 .

<p>
 •
 <b>
  CS4 Premiere Pro Window 7/64 bit
 </b>
 : Adjusting parameters for
 <b>
  Map Controls
