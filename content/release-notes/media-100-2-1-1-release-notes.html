<h2>
 A Note About Mac OS X 10.6.8
</h2>
<p>
 Apple released the Mac OS X 10.6.8 update in June 2011. A bug in this update disables playback with the Media 100 i Codec in NTSC 601 format. We are working with Apple to find a solution but the eventual outcome is unknown. We recommend that you not install the 10.6.8 update if you have existing i Codec media.
</p>
<h2>
 A Note About Mac OS X 10.7 “Lion”
</h2>
<p>
 Apple released the Mac OS X 10.7 update in July 2011. A bug in this version disables playback with the Media 100 i Codec in NTSC 601 format. We are working with Apple to find a solution but the eventual outcome is unknown. We recommend that you not install the 10.7 update if you have existing i Codec media.

</p>
<h4>

<h4>

 OpenCL: Media 100 Suite uses a software/hardware technology called OpenCL for fast, high quality image manipulation.
</h4>
<h4>
 Metadata: The new Metadata Window can manipulate metadata settings for media in the REDCODE (R3D) format, including camera color space, ISO speed, color temperature, etc.
</h4>
<h4>
 Video Decoder Quality: This preference option allows you to change the speed of playback and quality of the image when Media 100 Suite renders REDCODE media. Use this setting in conjunction with the new Catch Frame pixel accurate option to choose the best setting for your requirements.
</h4>
<h4>
 Catch Frame: The Catch Frame window now has a pixel accurate option, allowing you to examine any image, even 4K video, at full size on your Mac monitor. Use this view in conjunction with the Video Decorder Quality setting (which is settable from the Catch Frame window) to get the right combination of
</h4>
<p>
 speed and quality when rendering REDCODE media.
</p>
<h4>
 Mixed standards in program: Video clips of any standard, size and frame rate can be dropped into any program.
</h4>
<h4>
 Pan and Scan, Picture in Picture: The new Motion Editor allows you to zoom in or out of a selected
</h4>
<p>
 area of your source clip and place it anywhere in the program frame.
</p>
<h4>
 Conform: Conform now uses OpenCL rendering for higher quality upconvert and downconvert.
</h4>
<h4>
 ColorFX Window: The ColorFX dialog has been superseded by the ColorFX window, which allows
</h4>
<p>
 modeless access to all the ColorFX options (Classic, YUV Curves, YUV Levels, RGB Curves and RGB Levels) in one window for a smoother, faster workflow.
</p>
<h4>
 Import: A new option allows better color fidelity when importing QuickTime video from other sources. Media Search: You can identify those disk volumes which never contain media (for example, your Time
</h4>
<p>
 Machine backup volume) in the Project Settings window. This can help media searches find your files faster.
</p>
<h4>
 Media Search: During a media search, you can tell Media 100 Suite to skip the current volume when you
</h4>
<p>
 know it doesn’t contain the files you’re seeking.
</p>
<h4>
 Recent Projects: The Open Project dialog now remembers your last ten projects for easier navigation.
</h4>
<h4>
 Export to After Effects: Boris XML Transfer for Media 100 now computes the pixel aspect ratio correctly for standard definition media in After Effects CS/4 and CS/5.
</h4>
<h4>
 Keyboard Shortcuts: New keyboard shortcuts and contextual menus allow you to quickly navigate from the timeline to the effect you want (ColorFX, Metadata, Motion Editor, Voiceover).
</h4>
<h4>
 Discontinued: PowerPC-based Macs can not run Media 100 Suite 2.0. HDx hardware is not supported in Media 100 Suite 2.0. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard is not supported. The “Picture-in-Picture” transition has been removed; use the Motion Editor instead.

<h2>
 Additional Information
</h2>
<h4>
 HDV Support: Media 100 Suite uses a QuickTime® developer tool kit for HDV support, therefore it is required that users have installed codecs and device drivers to transcode HDV media streams into a format that can be used by Media 100 Suite. These codecs and device drivers are commonly installed with Apple Final Cut Pro®.
</h4>
<h4>
 FireWire Device Control, Video/Audio Input: Media 100 Suite uses the Apple QuickTime API for Video/Audio and Device control and it is possible that not all device functionality can or will be supported. Some devices have inherent functionality that is not available (e.g., jog/shuttle); some devices may need specific functionality to allow them to operate at all. In general, more expensive “High End” devices will have better success with Device Control and Video/Audio input and output.
</h4>
<h4>
 Audio Output Information: Audio output from your computer speaker may be a frame or two out of sync with video. If this occurs stop playback and try again.
</h4>
<h2>
 Known Issues
</h2>
<p class="s8">
 Workarounds as noted
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Acquire
 </b>
 - NTSC acquire using less than 5 seconds pre-roll causes a 1 frame shift in timecode of acquired clips on some decks; use the default of 5 if this occurs.
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Audio
 </b>
 - Software-only: when switching the Audio Out Preferences to "None" system will still output audio via the Mac speaker.
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Audio
 </b>
 - Software-only: User is not notified that the system audio device is disabled when FireWire Video/Audio Output is enabled.
</p>
<h4>
 -Batch Acquire - Some changes made in Change Media Attribute window may not be properly executed/displayed after Batch Reacquiring involved clips.
</h4>
<h4>
 -Batch Acquire - Attempting to batch acquire can result in a loss of sync and "Can't Record" errors in the Batch Acquire window with some FireWire devices.
</h4>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Batch Acquire
 </b>
 - Pre-roll / trim handles combination can cause black and/or missing frames at beginning of reacquired clips in NTSC or PAL on some decks; adjust these settings to default if this issue is encountered.
</p>
<h4>
 -Clip Presets - Clip Preset effects do not show up in the Boris RED UI when a Boris Transition is applied between Va &amp; Vb clips which also have Clip Preset effects applied.
</h4>
<h4>
 -Catch Frame - Colors in the Catch Frame “size to fit“ window may not exactly match those in the subsampler window. This is because the subsampler window uses a different mechanism for realtime drawing.
</h4>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Codecs
 </b>
 - When acquiring to the DVCPro50 or Motion JPEG B codec this material will get "flagged" that it uses a video color range. Material acquired into the Media 100 HD/i codec does not get this flag. Mixing both of these elements in After Effects (for example) will result in different levels/contrasts from the same material.
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Deck Control
 </b>
 - FireWire: If preferences are set to FireWire machine control but video set for composite, machine control may not work when entering Acquire mode.
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Deck Control
 </b>
 - FireWire: Some DV devices do not support Jog/Shuttle functionality. In general, device functionality is derived from the deck and Media 100 Suite can only use functions that are present on the device.
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Export
 </b>
 - QuickTime: If exporting via QuickTime fails, we recommend that you export as Self- Contained or By-Reference and then export that file from QuickTime Pro to the desired settings.
</p>
<h4>
 -Motion Editor – Colors in the Motion Editor window may not exactly match those in the subsampler when the Motion Editor is not displaying the composite view or when onscreen controls are enabled. This is because the subsampler window uses a different mechanism for realtime drawing.
</h4>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  MultiClip
 </b>
 - Syncing a video MultiClip and a VoiceOver clip together and then attempting to edit them in the MultiClip edit window may give unexpected results. The features are not intended to work in this way.
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Preferences
 </b>
 - When setting your DV deck control the deck ID is a series of numbers and/or letters. This is normal. If the device name or manufacturer information is available to Media 100 Suite, this information will be displayed.
</p>
<h4>
 -Real-time HDV Acquire - The older/slower the Macintosh computer, the less likely that Media 100 Suite will be able to acquire HDV in real-time. In that case Deferred HDV Acquire is recommended.
</h4>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Third-Party Software
 </b>
 - Media 100 Suite may report that the hardware is in use by another application if Final Cut Pro's Video Playback is set to Apple FireWire.
</p>
<p>
 -
 <b>
  Toolbar
 </b>
 - In Mac OS X 10.7 the toolbar button at the upper right of a window’s title bar has been removed. Media 100 Suite has “Show Toolbar” and “Hide Toolbar” menu commands to enable the same functionality. However, those commands are not applicable to floating windows, so if you have enabled floating monitor windows in General Preferences, you will not be able to access the toolbar on those windows. Those settings are still available in Project Settings.
</p>
<h4>
 Additional Notes:
</h4>
<h4>
 Hardware and Software Systems - Media 100 Video Out: If you use the Video Out feature in Adobe After Effects®, it is important to launch the Media 100 Suite software before you launch After Effects. This only affects Media 100 Video Out the first time you launch your new application. Subsequent uses of Media 100 Video Out do not require a launch of the Media 100 Suite application.
</h4>
<h4>
 Hardware and Software Systems - Codecs: Additional codecs such as AVC-Intra, Apple Uncompressed YUV 8 bit and 10 bit, DVC Pro HD, Apple ProRes (and variants) and Sony XDCAM are supported in Media 100 Suite but are not distributed with our software. If they are installed on the system, Media 100 Suite provides full support for these codecs. Some playback codecs are available at
 <a class="a" href="http://www.calibratedsoftware.com/" target="_blank">
  http://www.calibratedsoftware.com/
 </a>
</h4>
<h4>
 Hardware and Software Systems PAL - 16x9 clips conformed to 4:3 (letterbox): When batch acquiring the clip, the clip will appear as though you cropped it in the conform dialog rather than letterbox. You must software-conform because the hardware (with the exception of the Kona3 card) does not support conform-on-the-fly while acquiring.
