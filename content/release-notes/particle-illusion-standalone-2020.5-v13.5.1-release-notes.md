<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span>

Particle Illusion Standalone 2020.5 (v13.5.1) represents the first release of the legendary particle engine as a standalone/independent application since its relaunch under Boris FX.  Particle Illusion Standalone is a free application for macOS and Windows which supports direct render/export of particles (including alpha) without reliance on a host application or plugin integration.  It is an easy-to-use, GPU-based particle system with a template-driven workflow.  PI's emitter libraries include 2500+ starting templates covering classic particle effects plus creative and abstract effects, all of which can be endlessly customized.  Particle Illusion also remains available in plugin form as part of the larger Continuum product suite (which does require a license) where it includes additional capabilities such as host media integration, Mocha tracking and masking, Beat Reactor audio sync, additional composting options, and native host keyframing and scripting.  See the Boris FX website for a wealth of additional information.

**Continuum 2020.5 v13.5.1 for Adobe - Known Issues and Limitations:**

* Particle Illusion - custom GUI scroll bars do not react to Wacom tablet clicks. \[CO-5788\]
* Particle Illusion - The blue render progress bar does not fully extend to the end even when the render completes, making it appear as if the render is still in progress.  The render actually completes normally and this is just a lack of refresh in the progress widget itself.  \[CO-7909\]
