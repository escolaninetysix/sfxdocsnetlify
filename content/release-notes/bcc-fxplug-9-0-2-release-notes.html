<p><b> BCC 9.x FxPlug Compatibility Notes </b> :</p>
<p>While in general your previously saved projects should render identically in the newer version, bug fixes and quality improvements can sometimes change the look of older projects. While every effort is made to ensure project compatibility, the following notable areas may see some change to the look of previously saved projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>In all wipe-style transitions which contain Border options, the opacity of the border elements fades automatically at the start/end of transitions (except in manual mode) to fix potential jumps in the renders at the start and end of the transitions even when border offsets were non-zero.</li>
<li>The largely unnecessary Hold In / Hold Out parameters were removed from the Animation Tuning group in all transitions which could cause changes in the transition timing in the unlikely event these parameters had been changed from their defaults.</li>
<li>As part of the major performance optimizations implemented in Damaged TV for BCC9, some details can such as the randomization patterns can render differently although the overall feel of the effect should remain the same.</li>
<li>BCC9 fixes a bug introduced in BCC8.2 that affected the perceived rate of progress of the underlying dissolve in BCC Lens Transition. Projects saved in BCC8.2 or 8.3 may appear to render somewhat differently now that the dissolve rate has been fixed.</li>
<li>BCC9 fixes a gamma shift in some externally loaded images on Mac systems (such as those loaded by Pan and Zoom, or the particle files in Particle Emitter 3D, Organics Strands, or Particle Array) which caused the images to appear slightly too dark as compared to the original external image. These images now render correctly but Mac projects saved with these filters prior to BCC9 may display slight brightness boosts in such images.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> BCC FxPlug 9.0.2 - Known Issues and Limitations: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>28732 - BCC Extruded Text and BCC Type On Text use a custom text entry window and some of the changes that can be made through in this window are not reflected in the preview within the text window on Mac OS (although they will be apparent in the effect when previewed/rendered back in the host). The following text attributes do not preview within the text window:
<ul>
<li>Justification (when Word Wrap is not enabled)</li>
<li>Top Down Text</li>
<li>Right to Left Reading</li>
<li>Negative Line Leading</li>
<li>Italics (for fonts that don't include an italic typeface)</li>
<li>Superscript and Subscript</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>26068 - In BCC Particle Emitter 3D, changing the Blend Mode in the Spawn group can unexpectedly affect the main particle compositing.</li>
<li>27591 - As part of the new Motion Tracker workflow, if you change the tracker search width, target width, color space, or accuracy after an initial tracking pass, you must now reset the tracker data either with the reset button (in Motion) or with by making a minor change to the Tracker Center position (in FCP X) to force a refresh of the tracking data before starting a second tracker pass. (This extra step is not necessary if the tracker point picker location has changed.)</li>
<li>25867 - In BCC Type On Text the Line Leading in the text entry preview window does not accurately match up with the leading in the rendered result, and the leading may need to be adjusted to generate the desired final render.</li>
<li>27313 - The Beat Reactor propagation options generate unexpected results in Organic Strands. Use non-propagation modes which work as expected as a temporary workaround.</li>
<li>26750 - The Beat Reactor audio graph becomes less accurate as the Frequency Resolution is increased to high values. Use lower values near the default setting of 32 as a workaround.</li>
<li>29533 - The apply modes Boost Expo 1, 2, and 50/50 mix do not give the expected result in Grunge.</li>
<li>29777 - In Grunge the Edge Offset control in the Chromatic Aberration group is not working as designed</li>
<li>30613 - Flicker Fixer - When using the Key/Mask controls the intensity of the flicker correction is only half as strong as it should be, even in regions that should be fully corrected.</li>
<li>30351 - Pan and Zoom - Preview Mode rectangle widgets don’t match the final result exactly when using 3D Mode with non-square PAR comps.  Settings which tend to produce more exaggerated 3D perspective will increase the relative amount of difference between the preview widget and the final result.</li>
<li>30395 - Combining 3D Objects filters with other OpenGL accelerated BCC filters such as Lens Flare 3D or Grunge can occasionally cause render errors or instability due to lack of hardware resources depending on host resource use, graphics card capabilities, and BCC 4K preference settings.</li>
<li>28350 - Images brought in through well layers in BCC Generators are flipped horizontally and vertically in Motion 5 and corresponding FCP X Templates.  A non-generator version of the effect may be used as a workaround for the time being.</li>
<li>30741 - Scrubbing numerical fields in the Extruded Text or Type on Text text entry window can cause unexpected behavior.</li>
<li>27683 - Extruded Spline shifts location when viewed at reduced resolution.</li>
<li>28336 - 3D Objects - Textures are not rendered correctly for media with FCP native effects on them.</li>
<li>30732 - Enabling the blur option in Vignette does not work in 4k projects.</li>
<li>30740 - Well layer media in FCP that is part of a 1280 x 720p project sometimes fails to update with the correct frame and instead always displays the final frame of the clip.  We are working with Apple to resolve this issue.</li>
</ul>
