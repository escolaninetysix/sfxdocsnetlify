<h3>
 <a name="bookmark5">
 </a>
 New Library Browser Template Mode
 <a name="bookmark74">
 </a>
 ‌
</h3>
<p>
 You can now use the Library Browser in a special Template mode. The Boris Red Library Browser allows you to quickly preview and apply settings files from the KeyFrame Library, including settings files that you add or customize. The KeyFrame Library is a collection of preset effects that is automatically installed on your system when you install Boris Red. You can add, remove, or change these settings files at any time.
</p>
<p>
 Template mode allows you to use the Library Browser to create effects. This mode is most useful when creating text effects or when repeatedly applying the same preset. When you are in this mode, you simply replace the text for the selected effect template.
</p>
<p>
 When you select the Show Only Browser checkbox in the Preferences window, only the Library Browser appears when you work in the Boris Red user interface. This feature is only available when you use Boris Red as a plug in.

     Plug-Ins and Library Browser Now Accept Aliases
    </h3>
    <p>
     The Boris Red Plug-Ins folder and Library Browser now accept aliases to plug-in and effect files and folders on your system and will follow them to the original file or folder.
    </p>
    <h4>
     <a name="bookmark12">

     Aliases in the Library Browser
    </h4>
    <p>
     If you place an effect alias or shortcut to a folder or file in the Library Browser, Boris Red will now follow it to another folder or file, as if that folder were where the alias or shortcut is placed.
    </p>
    <h4>

     Aliases in the Plug-Ins folder
    </h4>
    <p>
     If you place an alias or shortcut to a folder or file in the Boris Red Plug-Ins folder, Boris Red will now follow it to another folder or file, as if that folder were where the alias or shortcut is placed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Boris Red Plug-Ins folder is found in the following location: Macintosh
    </p>
    <p class="s5">
     &lt;Drive&gt;:Library:Application Support:Boris FX, Inc:BorisPlugins
    </p>
    <p>
     Windows
    </p>
    <p class="s5">
     c:\Program Files\Boris FX, Inc\BorisPlugins\
    </p>
    <p>
     This means that you no longer need to make copies of your plug-ins, since you can now keep centrally located plug-in set(s).
    </p>
    <p>
     Boris Red currently only supports 8-bit plug-ins. Placing an alias or shortcut to 16-bit plug-ins in the Boris Red Plugins folder will cause undesirable results.

     Boris Red expands support for third Party After Effect plug-ins inside Incite. For best results, use only supported AE filters inside Boris Red.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of the unsupported filters will not appear in the Boris Red Filter menu even if they are installed, or will display an error message when you apply them.

         Tips for Using the Preview to Monitor Feature
        </h4>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Preview to Monitor automatically disconnects when you exit Boris Red. This means each time you start Boris Red, you need to choose Preview &gt; Connect to External Monitor in order to reconnect and see your image on the external monitor.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         To change the Preview to Monitor device or mode, disconnect Boris Red’s Preview to Monitor feature by choosing Disconnect External Monitor from the Preview menu. Open the Boris Red GL Preference window’s Preview tab to choose a new Device or Driver from the External Monitor Output menus. You can also reconnect via the Preview menu with those new settings in the same session.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Displaying images on an external monitor requires compressing and resizing the images. Boris Red might run slower if you have Auto Update enabled. Deselect Auto- Update Monitor in the Preview menu to remain connected to the external monitor but not automatically update frames.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Manually update frames to your external monitor by choosing Preview &gt; Display Frame to Monitor, or Preview &gt; Display HQ Frame to Monitor, or by pressing the Display Frame to Monitor button on the upper-right corner of the Composite window.

         However, Boris Red looks for all possible output devices upon installation, and lists the results in the Device menu in the Preview tab of the Boris Red preferences. As a result, users may be able to use a different output device for Boris Red than the one that the host application uses. The host application may use its own capture hardware for display, leaving the FireWire port available.

     Important Note on OpenGL
    </h3>
    <p class="s4">
     Due to the fast rate at which OpenGL card manufacturers release drivers, Boris Red may disqualify your OpenGL hardware erroneously. If this happens, you should try to enable OpenGL to see if you benefit from OpenGL acceleration. If you have troubles with slowness, or render inconsistencies, please disable OpenGL. 
    </p>
    <p>
     While OpenGL may work in the Boris Red standalone, that does not necessarily mean it will work inside your host application.
    </p>
    <p>
     Boris Red will make every effort to continue to qualify OpenGL cards and driver versions. However, it is important to note that it is impossible to qualify all combinations of OpenGL cards, operating system, drivers and host applications. In general you should run the latest supported driver available for your OpenGL card.

     Dual Monitor Limitations with OpenGL
    </h4>
    <p>
     Due to an issue with the NVidia card, Boris Red crashes if you are running the application on a dual monitor system with OpenGL. If you plan on using your Boris Red plug-in on a dual monitor system, you need to do one of the following:
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   With OpenGL enabled, you must display the Composite window on the left-hand monitor.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you want to display the Composite window on the right-hand monitor, you must disable OpenGL.
  </p>
  <p>
   With OpenGL enabled:
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The system default displays the Composite window on the left-hand monitor. If it’s on the right-hand monitor, click and drag the Composite window to the left-hand monitor.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 To disable Open GL from the Preferences dialog box:
</p>
<ol id="l12">
 <li>
  <p>
   From Boris Red, select Edit &gt; Preferences.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Click the Render tab.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   From the OpenGL Acceleration menu, select Off.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can then display the Composite window on the right-hand monitor.
  </p>
  <p>
   To disable Open GL from the Preview menu:
  </p>
  <ul id="l13">
   <li>
    <p>
     From the Composite window, select Preview &gt; OpenGL Mode &gt; Off.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 This disables OpenGL. You can then display the Composite window on the right-hand monitor.
</p>
<h4>
 <a name="bookmark47">
 </a>
 Checking your OpenGL Hardware, Software, Drivers and Settings
</h4>
<p>
 The first time you launch Boris Red, an internal test is run on your system to determine whether your hardware meets the minimum requirements necessary for OpenGL Hardware acceleration. If your hardware does not meet the minimum requirements, OpenGL is disabled by default on your system.
</p>
<ol id="l14">
 <li>
  <p>
   To perform the OpenGL Hardware test manually, click the Test OpenGL Hardware button in the Preferences window’s Render tab.
  </p>
  <p>
   Depending on the amount of memory your graphics card has, this test may take a few minutes to run.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the test is run, a window displays specifics of the hardware and drivers installed on your system which are necessary to run OpenGL. If any test results show your system may have problems running OpenGL, the errors are detailed in this window.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you want, click the Copy to Clipboard button to copy this information to your system clipboard. This allows you to print or e-mail this information.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you finish, click OK to close this window.
  </p>
  <p>
   Depending on your system, the test may take a few seconds to complete. The test stresses your OpenGL hardware, so you should run the test with a typical workload on your system. Before you run the OpenGL hardware test, open any graphics applications that you usually run while you edit (any graphics intensive applications you are running at the time may affect the results).
  </p>
  <p>
   Boris Red uses the following guidelines for optimal OpenGL performance. Some of this information does not affect Boris Red’s hardware testing but is useful for technical support if you are having OpenGL problems:
  </p>
  <ul id="l15">
   <li>
    <p>
     OpenGL version - Should be 1.2 and higher.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Texture Rectangle - This is an advanced OpenGL image sizing feature. If you are having OpenGL problems, this provides useful information for technical support.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Texture Memory - Texture Memory displays the amount of memory on the video card available for Boris Red to use for textures (layer images).To use Boris Red without display or performance problems, Texture Memory must be at least 32MB. Texture Memory available is not the absolute of memory on your card, but rather the amount available to Boris Red.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Texture Dimension displays the maximum texture size that can be used with the video card.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 Macintosh OS Version displays the installed version of the Macintosh OS (if you are running on a Macintosh system.) Macintosh users must have at least Macintosh OS

     OpenGL Errors
    </h4>
    <p>
     When the OpenGL Hardware Test is run, error messages may display if your system fails. These errors display as Hardware Status errors or Critical Testing errors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hardware Status errors report the status of your current system setup against Boris Red’s recommended card manufacturer, model and driver. These errors do not prevent you from using OpenGL, they just warn that your specific system and setup may cause problems with OpenGL. Hardware Status errors can include messages such as insufficient available texture memory or reports that your card was not recognized by Boris Red’s internal hardware testing. When you receive a Hardware Status error, OpenGL is automatically disabled when you launch Boris Red. However, you can manually enable OpenGL in the Boris Red Preferences window.
    </p>
    <p>
     Critical Testing errors report errors that will not allow you to use OpenGL in Red. When you receive a Critical Testing error, OpenGL is automatically disabled when you launch Red. If you receive a Critical Testing error, you should not enable OpenGL or you may crash. Certain errors are influenced by the display properties set on your video card. The display property settings are card-driver specific. As a general rule, the display properties should be set to 32 bits of color, with the depth buffer set to at least 16 bits. On many cards the OpenGL capabilities are reduced when higher display resolution and refresh rates are set.

       Display problems such as white, rainbow or garbage images in the Composite window may be related to OpenGL. If this occurs, open the Preference window. In the Render tab, change the OpenGL Acceleration menu to use less texture caching. Texture caching is used for textures (layer images) and is related to the amount of Texture memory on the video card. Display problems related to OpenGL will not affect your rendered effects.

     Exporting as Flash
    </h4>
    <p>
     Boris Red allows you to export files in the Macromedia Flash (SWF) format. This feature allows you to export compositions as compact, vector-based files optimized for web viewing. For example, you could export a Type On effect to include on a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
     The SWF format was designed primarily for animated 3D Line Art objects, so it works well when exporting settings that contain spline and text animations. Settings that contain video or animated bitmaps, however, generate rather large files. You might want to consider exporting such animations as a QuickTime or AVI file.
    </p>
    <p>
     See “Exporting Effects as Movies” in the Help for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are some limitations with the Flash export feature. You cannot export 3D Extrusion tracks as Flash. Settings that contain the 3D Extrusion tracks export as a blank track. The Flash export feature does not support shadows or gradients used as Texture tracks. However, you can export a static gradient as a bitmap background.
    </p>
    <p class="s6">
     NOTE: To prepare to export to Flash, you should change any shape track containing EPS files, text, or Spline media to 3D Line Art shape. Because you cannot use the 3D Line Art shape with the Brush tool, you cannot export brush strokes as Flash.
    </p>
    <p>
     To export a track as a Flash file:
    </p>
    <ol id="l21">
     <li>
      <p>
       Select the appropriate track in the timeline.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Choose File &gt; Export &gt; Flash.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dialog box appears that allows you to name and save the file.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Name the track and click Save.
      </p>
      <p>
       The composition is exported using the Flash Export settings, which are controlled by the Preferences window’s Export tab. For more information, see the Help.

       Creating Time Effects within Boris Red
      </h3>
      <p>
       The following important notes pertain to Time filters, including Optical Flow.
      </p>
      <ul id="l22">
       <li>
        <p>
         Exporting an effect containing a Time filter (including Optical Flow) with host media is NOT recommended. If you want to export from Boris Red with Optical Flow (or any Time filter) in the timeline, you should use imported media in the source track.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is because Boris Red does not receive both fields at set-up (preview). In that case, the first field of each frame goes into the motion estimator. If the motion is small from one frame to the next, and/or includes little crossing motion, the preview appears close to the rendered output. However, if the motion is large, and/or includes a lot of crossing motion, it is important for the motion estimator to have access to both fields in order to see an accurate preview of the rendered result.

         Important Information about Working with Motion Filters
        </h3>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You should use the Snap CTI to KeyFrame option (Track &gt; Snap CTI to KeyFrame) when working with the Motion filters to avoid confusion. For example, this option is not selected and you move the CTI off a selected keyframe. Then you adjust the Search and Target parameters using on-screen controls. A new keyframe is not
        </p>
        <p>
         created. Instead, the selected keyframe is adjusted. This could cause your media to track incorrectly. If you want to create a new keyframe, you must deselect all keyframes before adjusting parameters on-screen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         While Interpolation Fields appear next to the Search/Target tab parameters, you should not adjust the Interpolation. Leave the Interpolation set to Hold. Adjusting the Interpolation will not affect the tracking but may cause on-screen parameters to display incorrectly.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You can work at Half or Quarter Resolution to achieve a preview of a motion filter. But if the motion tracker fails repeatedly, you may have to work at Full Resolution.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You can only adjust the Search and Target regions in the Motion filter track's Preview window. The Source track does not display the region controls; the Composite window does not display the region controls.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The field order of the media must match the field order setting in the Media tab. You can set this in the Import tab in the Preferences window. See the Help for more information.

 Important Information Using the KeyFrame Library
</h3>
<p>
 The first time you browse the KeyFrame Library effects within the Library Browser you must generate thumbnail images for the effects.
</p>
<ol id="l23">
 <li>
  <p>
   Open the Boris Red Library Browser, by choosing Window &gt; Library Browser, clicking the Open Library Browser button in the timeline or pressing Control-9.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Select an effect or effect folder and click the Generate Thumbnails button. For more information on using the KeyFrame Library, see the Help.
  </p>
  <p class="s6">
   NOTE: We recommend that when you build thumbnail previews for the KeyFrame Library, you do this in the Boris Red standalone application. Because building previews actually renders your effect, this process can take as much as 25- 30% longer in the plug-in than in the Boris Red standalone application.

   <li>
    <p>
     The text window will only update the text with changes made to the control window (such as Margin, Wrap, or Font) when you press the update button in the text generator window or close the text generator window.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Changes to the controls text window are ignored if the text generator window is open.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When cell is set in the Apply To pop-up, none of the changes in the animation tab will have an effect on bar charts although the numbers in the numeric entry box change to show the animation.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Default interpolation is set in the keyframe options palette, not the preferences window.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When OGL is enabled and you re-enter an effect, the resulting image appears white in the Composition window. To change this, press Control + [. This disables the OGL preview and revrts to non-OGL mode.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
<ul id="l25">

   The Motion Blur button is a global preference. That means that, when you render, all settings respect the last setting of this checkbox in the UI. This is not a bug, but can be confusing when you render multiple effects in the Render Queue.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you tumble an object that has an image bump map (such as a movie or still image file), you may see a moire pattern as it tumbles.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you reopen a saved setting where you previously changed the color of a border or gradient using the eyedropper, in some instances the color has reverted back to its original color.

   When you save a style to the Materials tab in the Style Palette, it does not correctly save the Source type that was used in the Bump Map tab.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The V key in the new Color Preview feature does not work to commit to a color. You can use the C key to dynamically preview colors, but you cannot use the V key to commit to them. Click the mouse instead.

   Resuming a partial render of an exported QuickTime file may have some undesirable side-effects. In particular, video compressed with codecs that use frame- differencing and data-rate-limiting (such as Sorenson or Cinepak) may exhibit some of the following behavior during playback.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some frames following the resume point may be corrupted. The data rate may be slightly larger than expected. Also, if the file includes an audio track, a slight blip may be heard at the resume point. This may occur with any codec.

  <ul id="l26">
   <li>
    <p>
     If you use Frame-Differenced movies in Boris Red (including movies compressed with Apple’s QuickTime Animation codec, and some movies compressed with Sorenson), you will see reduced performance. The use of Frame-Differenced movies is not recommended within Boris Red.

   <li>
    <p>
     Any effect that uses a filter involving edge detection (for example, RGB Edges) should be rendered with the Better Quality Field Rendering checkbox selected. Otherwise, the rendered effect will jitter.

     Tracking controls the global horizontal spacing of the characters in an effect. Tracking behaves differently depending on whether the text was created with the Text tool or in the Text window.

     Limitations with Chart Features
    </h3>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Accented letters such as é are not passed from the Chart Editor to the Chart Container correctly. Therefore, a Chart Legend or Grid label that uses accented characters must be entered directly into the text track, using the Text tool or Text window. If this is necessary, it must be done as a final step when building the chart. This is because editing the chart data or enabling/disabling the Legend or Grid updates this text using Chart Editor text; as a result, the accented characters will be lost.

    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Selecting the “Apply Current Spline Style” checkbox can create unintended changes if the setting is modified after another spline style is selected. For example, you create a static Line chart setting with the “Apply Current Spline Style” checkbox selected. You apply another spline style from the Style Palette to a different track. If you then animate the chart, the chart will update with the latest spline style, rather than the style originally applied. The workaround is to reapply the original spline style from the Style Palette.

     Some filters create effects that evolve over time based on parameter settings. The output of these filters (for example Velocity Remap, Particle System, Comet) depends on the parameter values for the entire effect; changing a parameter value on any frame changes the output for all subsequent frames. If the animation jumps after changing a parameter, the jump is probably because Boris Red did not invalidate frames that were affected by the change. You can fix this by choosing Edit
