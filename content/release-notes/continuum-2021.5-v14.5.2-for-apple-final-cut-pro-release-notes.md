**Continuum 2021.5 FCP (v14.5.2) Compatibility Notes:**

* Projects made in the public 14.0.x beta version of Continuum FCP that use BCC+ filters will NOT come forward to the officially shipping version of Continuum 2021.5 due to the architectural restructuring required to support the latest Fxplug SDK.  Projects created with the beta software  should be finished with the beta software and then archived.
* Since Continuum 2021.5 includes only "BCC+" filters.  You need to install Continuum 2020.5 side-by-side with Continuum 2020.5 if you want to access older BCC filters.

**Continuum 2021.5 FCP (v14.5.2) - Known Issues and Limitations:**

* CO-8847 - Mac Installer Registration Dialog fails the installer if certain unicode characters were entered on a previous installer run
* CO-9290 - Licensing - Occasionally the license activation tool does not pop up automatically after installation on Mac.  Re-running the installer should pop up the tool on the next run.
* CO-9331 - Project pane thumbnails sometimes render with tiling artifacts when a BCC+ effect is applied.  This affects only the thumbnails and not the effect results in the timeline.  We are working with Apple engineering to resolve this issue.
* CO-9391 - 3 BCC+ filters clamp in HDR projects - Film Stocks, Cross Processing, Color Paste
* CO-9390 - BCC+Composite reverts to CPU if Transform Scale X param is scrubbed
* CO-9370 - BCC+ Color Gradient - ND Brightness feature ignores alpha
* CO-9369 - BCC+ Lens Flare - incorrect result in some cases when compositing with soft alpha comps
