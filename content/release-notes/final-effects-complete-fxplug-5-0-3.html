  <h1>
   Additional optimizations to the built-in Motion Tracker
  </h1>
  <p>
   Most every filter in the FEC package includes a built-in motion tracker that may be used to control the x/y position of a light source or the center point of any object such as a geometric primitive or a bulge or the x/y position of a PixelChooser mask. This feature has undergone optimizations in FEC 5.0.3 to make working with the Motion Tracker feature faster and easier than ever before.

  <h1>
   Optimizations to the Built-In PixelChooser
  </h1>
  <p>
   The PixelChooser feature, which is included in all FEC filters has been optimized to further enhance performance, meaning shorter render times and greater user interactivity.

  <h1>
   Overall Performance Enhancements
  </h1>
  <p>
   All filters in FEC 5.0.3 now render faster than ever before as a result of the many optimizations that have been made to core algorithms in the product.

   Faster Downloads
  </h1>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 More and more people rely upon electronic downloads for their software updates and with that in mind we have reduced the size of the FEC product installer to make downloading and installing this new version faster and easier than ever before. Improvements on the Macintosh installer amount to an almost 50 percent reduction in the size of the downloaded file, meaning that your download times will essentially be halved. On Windows, we are seeing about a 30 percent reduction in the size of the installer.
