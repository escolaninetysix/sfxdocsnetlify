 What’s New in FEC 5.0.2?
</h2>
<p>
 The following features and enhancements were added to version 5.0.2 of FEC for FxPlug:
</p>
<ul id="l1">
 <li>

   <b>
    Field Rendering Support -
   </b>
   Users now have the option to render their filter effects in
   <i>
    <b>
     Speed Optimized
    </b>
   </i>
   mode (Field Rendering) or
   <i>
    <b>
     Quality Optimized
    </b>
   </i>
   mode (Frame Rendering). The
   <b>
    Field Rendering
   </b>
   menu, located in the Common Controls, sets the rendering optimization. Not all filters include this option. Good to know:
  </p>
  <ul id="l2">
   <li>
    <p>
     For most filters, you can use the default of Speed Optimized - which results in faster filter rendering. Some filters default to Quality Optimized; in this case you should not use Speed Optimized.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     For effects that include edging, DVE moves or fast frame-to-frame movement, you may want to use Quality Optimized. Quality Optimized takes more time to render, but will generally correct any problems with jitter or rough edges on effects.
