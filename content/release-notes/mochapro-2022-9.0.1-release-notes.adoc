== Introduction

These release notes accompany *Mocha Pro {revision}*.

This is a maintenance release with some new features and defect fixes.
Release notes cover Mocha Pro, for both standalone and Plug-in versions of the product.

Documentation is available inside *Mocha Pro {revision}* by pressing the F1 key.

== Build notes

Please read the following notes carefully as they may affect efficient use of the product.

IMPORTANT: OFX builds of the Mocha Pro Plug-in have been tested to work with Autodesk Flame 2020-2021, The Foundry Nuke, Blackmagic Fusion Studio, HitFilm Pro, Vegas Pro and Silhouette v6+. +
Other hosts that utilize OFX may operate the Mocha Pro OFX Plug-in correctly, but at this stage they are unofficially supported and may experience problems. +
While Mocha will work in Blackmagic Resolve 16+, rendering can be slow.

WARNING: Version {revision} changes some file paths and directories from previous versions, including the image cache. We recommend clearing your old Mocha caches before installing this version.

WARNING: Projects created with version {revision} may not be backwards compatible with earlier versions of Mocha.

WARNING: Mocha Pro 2022 requires macOS 10.14 or higher for Intel CPUs or 10.15 and higher for Apple silicon M1 support. +
Some Mocha features, like GStreamer, are not supported on Apple M1 systems at this time.

== New features in Mocha Pro 2022 9.0.1

* *Restore Default Preferences:* You can now reset back to the default preferences via a button in the main preferences dialog
* *Improved Insert rendering:* Insert edges are smoother.

== New features in Mocha Pro 2022 9.0.0

=== New Insert Module features

* *Insert Mesh Warp:* Now drive insert warp with the PowerMesh tracker. You can also weight how much the insert grid is influenced by the mesh.
* *Added resampling options:* The Insert Module can now be rendered with different resampling methods, such as nearest neighbor, bilinear and Lanczos (for different kernel sizes).
* *Insert Blend Modes:* Blend modes can now be chosen inside the application, making it easier to visualise final results or render to plugin hosts
* *Streamlined Insert Module:* Insert interface and grid warp has been optimized for easier use

=== Architecture updates

* *Apple silicon Support:* You can now use Mocha with Apple M1 chipsets under Apple silicon supported systems.
* *VFX Platform 2022:* Mocha is updated to support the new reference platform for the VFX industry standard, including OCIO 2.0, which has much greater visual accuracy and performance.
* *After Effects Multithreaded support:* Mocha now supports After Effects multithreaded rendering

=== Dopesheet improvements

* *Slide keyframes:* You can now move all keyframes easily in time as one group or by selection
* *Keyframe zooming:* It is now much easier to zoom into selected keyframes and zoom out to all keyframes. Mouse dopesheet zooming now also zooms at the cursor point.

=== Exports

* *PowerMesh to Nuke Tracker:* Create a single Nuke tracker node with tracker points representing every vertex in the PowerMesh.
* *PowerMesh to Alembic Transform:* Export PowerMesh vertex position data to individual transform nulls instead of closed geometry
* *Silhouette shapes with split transform data:* Silhouette shapes now export with keyframe data split out to make it easier to add new Silhouette shapes which inherit the tracking data.
* *Nuke Roto nodes with split transform data:* Nuke Roto now exports with keyframe data split out to make it easier to add new Nuke roto splines which inherit the tracking data
* *Mistika Corner Pin:* You can now export Mocha planar tracking data to Mistika

=== Tracking improvements

* *Quick Stabilize Preview Update:* You can now quick-stabilize pan and zoom via any layer rather than just the currently selected layer. This option is available via a dropdown on the Quick Stabilize button.
* *Multi-linking:* Link multiple selected layers to the same track using “Link to Track”
* *Mesh Track Using Existing Data:* Linking PowerMeshes to existing planar tracking layers makes it easier to combine planar tracking with PowerMesh tracking for roto and other tasks.
* *RGB Tracking:* You can now select individual channels for tracking rather than just Luminance or Auto Channel
* *RGB views:* Preview each channel separate from the RGB dropdown in View controls.

=== Minor Updates

* 360 spline editing has been improved so over warping no longer occurs on large perspective changes
* Improved AdjustTrack parameters now adjust all track keyframes based on the motion types selected
* Layer editing is now possible outside set layer frame ranges
* Channel selection has been changed to a dropdown
* Data exports from Mocha to Silhouette now contain Silhouette-friendly frame offsets

| *Platform:* | All Platforms
| *Product:* | All Products
| *Bug Description:* | Attaching a corner pin node to a Mocha Pro OFX node will crash Nuke.
| *Workaround:* | 1. Execute any processing used in the OFX node: +
When using a Mocha Pro node, saving and executing any changes within the Plug-in appears to stop the crashes.
So using the node and editing the CornerPin before executing the saved changes crashes Nuke.

2. Place a processing node in-between the OFX & CornerPin nodes: +
Adding a processing node in-between the two nodes (e.g. Blur) works around the issue, as the transformation information is processed before being passed through the CornerPin node.
For example, having Mocha->Blur->CornerPin stops the process loop from crashing.
