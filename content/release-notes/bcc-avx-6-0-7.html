<h1>
 New Features and Improvements
</h1>
<ul id="l1">
 <li>
  <p>
   Improvements in memory handling for BCC Optical Stabilizer, Pan and Zoom, Motion Key, Degrain, Match Grain. Some filters in previous versions of BCC displayed memory issues when using image files large dimensions. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Long drive names no longer cause a problem when using BCC 6 on the Macintosh platform. In previous versions of BCC 6, Macintosh systems that used drives with excessively long names caused problems for the BCC filters. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The Motion Tracker overlay widget did not always respond as expected when attempts were made to resize or scale the tracking target or region boxes. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In the previous release, BCC filters that were "bypassed" were unexpectedly using memory. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The BCC Optical Stabilizer filter was prone to error when analyzing progressive clips. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In the previous release, pop-ups for external file selection in some filters displayed incorrect options. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   On systems that include the Nitris hardware option, BCC Degrain and BCC Match Grain filters could cause instability in the host under certain conditions. This issue has been resolved with the BCC 6.0.7 release.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<h1>
 Important Note
</h1>
<p>
 We highly recommend that any mounted disc drives contain less than 27 characters in the drive name and that special characters or symbols should be avoided when using BCC filters on Macintosh systems. Non-adherence to this recommendation may result in instability in the host environment.
