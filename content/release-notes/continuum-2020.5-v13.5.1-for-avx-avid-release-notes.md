For a full list of what's new between Continuum 2020.5 and the previous Continuum 2020 major release please refer to the initial 2020.5 release notes here:

[Continuum 2020.5 (v13.5.1) AVX - Avid Release Notes](/release-notes/continuum-2020-5-v13-5-0-for-avx-avid-release-notes/)

**Feature Enhancements in 2020.5 (v13.5.1) for AVX - Avid Media Composer:**

**Particle Illusion - ProRes Render/Export directly from PI UI:**

* You can now Render/Export directly from within the Particle Illusion UI including to ProRes formats with embedded alpha channels.  Either select the Render button at the top of the Stage view or use CTRL/CMD + R to bring up the Render dialog where you can adjust the render settings and export.  Rendering directly from the PI UI offers much faster renders for more complex PI projects as well as the flexibility to render from the standalone version.

**Particle Illusion - HUD prefs:**

* New user preference settings for Particle Illusions's HUD widget colors and opacity inside the PI UI.

**Particle Illusion - Force Field Grid Drawing Refinement:**

* Force Field Grid drawing is now more responsive and visually cleaner (including only drawing full grid for selected Force and improved line quality)

**Title Studio Reflection Map Quality:**

* Reflection Maps now scale more accurately and with improved antialiasing

**Continuum 2020.5 (v13.5.1) for AVX - Avid - Compatibility Notes:**

While in general your previously saved projects should render identically in the newer version, bug fixes and quality improvements can sometimes change the look of older projects. While every effort is made to ensure project compatibility, the following notable areas may see some change to the look of previously saved projects.

* Dissolve Transitions: A fix for better match between 8/16/float bitdepth results when using the optional Color boost transition parameters such as Brightness and Contrast means that the look of some previous projects will have changed slightly in 8 and 16bit projects.
* Integrated Glow group (in Particle Illusion, Reframer, Beauty Studio, Light Leaks).  Previously the glow radius did not auto-scale with clip resolution causing presets to look different on HD vs 4k if they used the glow feature prominently.  Old projects with integrated glow might need to tweak the glow radius when reopened in the new version to adjust for this change.  (This does NOT affect Fast Film Glow or Fast Film Glow Dissolve).
* Particle Illusion and Particle Illusion Dissolve:  Fixes to random property granularity may change the details of individual particles in some projects, although the overall look and feel should remain the same.
* Particle Illusion and Particle Illusion Dissolve:  Fixes to Free Emitter birth timing may change the grouping/placement of particles in some projects, although the overall look and feel should remain the same.

**Continuum 2020.5 (v13.5.1) for AVX - Avid - Known Issues and Limitations:**

* mocha PixelChooser - mocha track data is not saved with presets.  To clone mocha tracking data from one effect instance or machine or host to another, you can use the File->Export Project and File->Merge Project options from within the mocha UI or you can copy/paste track data from the clipboard when moving from one mocha UI instance to another. \[CO-4250\]
* Custom UI views such as the Title Studio UI, FX Browser, License Dialog, or Preferences Dialog don't fully adapt to High-DPI displays on windows which can cause some fonts to render too small and be difficult to read. \[CO-3269\]
* Title Studio - Snap to guide - snapping is offset by 2 pixels. \[CO-5071\]
* Particle Illusion - custom GUI scroll bars do not react to Wacom tablet clicks. \[CO-5788\]
* Moving Mocha from one monitor to another and relaunching it can cause UI refresh problems with mixed monitor resolutions \[CO-5829\]
