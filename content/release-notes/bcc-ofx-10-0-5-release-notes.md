<h3>Boris Continuum Complete 10.0.5 for OFX - Release Notes</h3>

<p>BCC 10.0.5 for OFX (OpenFX) hosts was released on 2/10/2017 and is an update to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Boris Continuum Complete 10.0.3 for OFX (<a title="BCC 10 OFX – 10.0.3 Release Notes" href="/release-notes/bcc-ofx-10-0-3-release-notes/" target="_blank">BCC 10.0.3 OFX Release Notes</a>)</li>

<li>Boris Continuum Complete 10.0.2 for OFX (<a title="BCC 10 OFX – 10.0.2 Release Notes" href="/release-notes/bcc-ofx-10-0-2-release-notes/" target="_blank">BCC 10.0.2 OFX Release Notes</a>)</li>

<li>Boris Continuum Complete 10.0.0 for OFX (<a title="BCC 10 OFX – 10.0.0 Release Notes" href="https://www.borisfx.com/bcc-ofx-10-0-0-release-notes/" target="_blank">BCC 10.0.0 OFX Release Notes</a>)</li>

</ul>

<p>BCC 10.0.5 for OFX officially supports Nuke, DaVinci Resolve, and Vegas.  Official support for additional OFX hosts will be added in future updates.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Enhancements in BCC 10.0.5 for OFX:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Floating RLM License Server:

<ul>

<li>BCC now supports an RLM floating license server model for enterprise facilities.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>mocha PixelChooser GPU enhancements:

<ul>

<li>Improved OpenCL tracking accuracy.</li>

<li>Improved OpenCL tracking performance.</li>

<ul></ul>

</ul>

</li>

<li>3D Objects + <span>Title Studio</span> Performance:</li>

<ul>

<li>Major performance enhancements for all 3D Objects filters including Title Studio on many GPU models.</li>

</ul>

<li>Title Studio FX Browser/Advanced UI toggle:</li>

<ul>

<li>New FX Browser / Advanced UI mode buttons next to the Cancel/Apply buttons allow jumping directly between the FX Browser and Advanced UI views in Title Studio.  No need to return to the host UI anymore to switch between views.</li>

</ul>

<li>Title Studio FX Browser text entry improvements:</li>

<ul>

<li>Text entry workflow in the FX Browser has been re-engineered for easier and more flexible use.  The new "Use Current Timeline Text" checkbox controls whether the preset is rendered with the text that was originally saved with the preset or with the text already present in the timeline before the FX Browser was launched.  Additionally if you type in your own custom text it will always use the custom text entry as opposed to the timeline's text or the preset's text.  This simplifies browsing through preset templates since the original preset text is preserved by default, yet it also supports the ability to customize text in the FX Browser as well as the ability to use the previously entered timeline text with new presets if desired. </li>

</ul>

<li>Numerous bug fixes</li>

</ul>

<br />

<ul>

<li>In order to access the mocha PixelChooser, BCC Optical Stabilizer, and FX Browser dynamic video previews when running in DaVinci Resolve, you must use the paid Studio version of Resolve and you must use Resolve Studio 12.5 or higher.</li>

</ul>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Training:</strong></p>

<p>Numerous resources are available for helping you get the most out of Boris Continuum Complete.</p>

<ul>

<li>Help documents for individual BCC effects are accessible directly from each plug-in’s UI.  The entire <a href="/documentation/continuum/bcc-effects-list/" title="BCC Help Documentation">BCC Help Documention</a> library is also available on the BorisFX website, including access to a downloadable version for browsing <a href="https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/store/BCC10Documentation.zip" title="Offline Downloadable BCC Help Documentation">offline BCC Help Documentation</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/videos/?tags=category:Continuum%20TV&search=">BorisTV</a> video tutorials cover a huge range of topics from introductions to the Fundamentals, to deep training Webinar Replays, to in-depth looks at  key effects and techniques.</li>

</ul>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>BCC OFX 10.x Compatibility Notes:</strong><br />While in general your previously saved projects should render identically in the newer version, bug fixes and quality improvements can sometimes change the look of older projects. While every effort is made to ensure project compatibility, the following notable areas may see some change to the look of previously saved projects.</p>

<ul>

<li>3D Objects Extrusion Styles now scale with text point size but this can in some cases cause different scaling when opening saved projects which might require readjustment.</li>

<li>The BCC Motion Tracker in OFX hosts will continue to render previously saved motion tracker analysis passes and it will continue to support loading externally generated tracker data files such as those exported from mocha, but conducting new BCC Motion Tracker analysis passes is disabled in OFX hosts other than Vegas in order to ensure full cooperation with host multi-threading requirements.</li>

<li>Rays Dissolve - a fix to the Region Animation rotation control will cause the region size to appear slightly larger when opening saved projects which used this Region Animation option.</li>

<li><span>3D Objects - Faces with partial opacity now render with more accurate combined opacities from multiple overlapping faces.  This may require re-tweaking the opacity if you used partially transparent faces in saved 3D Objects projects.</span> </li>

</ul>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>BCC OFX 10.0.5 - Known Issues and Limitations:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Title Studio Plugin Mac - Menu Bar doesn't update back when toggling apps until you cancel or apply from Title Studio UI. [1539]</li>

<li>BCC Motion Blur now includes an Advanced optical flow option which uses OpenCL hardware assisted rendering to implement a more sophisticated (and more computationally intensive) motion vector analysis.  The performance of the Advance mode varies widely from one graphics card to another and if you see reduced performance or unexpected results when using the Advanced option it is recommended that you switch to the Simple mode on that card. [706 + 1094]</li>

<li>Title Studio - The Frame Cache is not automatically Purged when you manually change the PAR (pixel aspect ratio). [1964]</li>

<li>Title Studio - Some C4D files show inaccurate colors or blocky shape geometries. [2271]</li>

<li>Text labels for point pickers and other HUD widgets can appear malformed in some hosts on some Retina displays. [2574]</li>

<li>mocha PixelChooser - mocha track data is not saved with presets.  To clone mocha tracking data from one effect instance or machine or host to another, you can use the File-&gt;Export Project and File-&gt;Merge Project options from within the mocha UI. [645]</li>

<li>mocha PixelChooser - tracking data does not adjust if the user changes the clip trim on the front end of the clip after tracking.  The clip will need to be re-tracked if the trim is changed on the front.  You can minimize the amount of re-tracking by re-aligning the contours within the mocha UI with the Ubey-key, offsetting the contour to re-align it, and then re-tracking the remainder as necessary. [1076]</li>

<li>mocha PixelChooser - export to BCC motion tracker formats requires the host application be set to full resolution for the exported track data to be correctly scaled. [1675]</li>

<li>Motion Tracker data import sometimes fails to set the correct track location due to a Resolve host-side bug.  Closing and relaunching Resolve and then re-importing the external tracker data may work around this issue. [3099]</li>

<li><span>3D Objects filters may render black on some systems in Nuke the very first time Nuke is launched after installing or updating BCC.  Relaunching Nuke after the first launch eliminates the problem.</span></li>

<li>Custom UI views such as the Title Studio UI, FX Browser, License Dialog, or Preferences Dialog don't adapt to High-DPI displays on windows which can cause some fonts to render too small and be difficult to read. [3335]</li>

</ul>
