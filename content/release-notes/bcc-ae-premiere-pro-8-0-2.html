  BCC AE 8.0.2 - Known Issues and Limitations
 </b>
 :
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Known issues that are specific to Mac OS:
 </b>
 • On Mac OS, BCC AE cannot open presets that use names with non-ASCII text characters in them, and saving a preset named with non-ASCII characters will result in a file with unexpected garbage characters in the name.
</p>
<p>
 • On Mac OS, loading an external media file from a folder named with non-ASCII text characters will fail and can result in a crash.
</p>
<p>
 • When taking an AE project that uses BCC 3D Objects created on Mac CS4 or earlier, and opening that project in CS5 (Mac or Windows) Texture Files or Bump Files referenced in the 3D Objects' materials will not be found by the plugins and will need to be manually reset to get the effect to appear as expected. (In this case a warning is displayed.)
</p>
<p>
 • When using the 3D Objects category of effects on Mac OS, enabling the "Transparent Object" checkbox will result in the object becoming fully transparent (so this feature is not useful on Mac).
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Known issues that apply to both Mac OS and Windows OS:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • BCC Optical Stabilizer will sometimes generate jitter artifacts in interlaced projects.
</p>
<p>
 • BCC Snow occasionally exhibits jumps in the flake position.
</p>
<p>
 • In BCC Particle Emitter 3D the interaction layer is not working accurately with 3D Text layers unless they are precomposed at comp dimensions.
</p>
<p>
 • In BCC Particle Emitter 3D, changing the Blend Mode in the Spawn group can unexpectedly affect the main particle compositing.
</p>
<p>
 • BCC Damaged TV can exhibit incorrect render details when applied to alpha footage.
</p>
<p>
 • In Premiere Pro only, enabling the Use Individual Layers control in BCC Pin Art will generate a rendered error message.
</p>
<p>
 • Several render quality improvements were made to Film Glow, particularly when applied to content with an alpha channel. As a result of these improvements, previously saved Film Glow projects may render somewhat differently when opened in 8.0.1 or higher.
</p>
<p>
 • Due to fixes in random number generator pattern differences between mac and win projects, you may see differences between random patterns in saved BCC7 projects when opened in BCC8. The overall “look” will remain the same but the details of the random patterns may shift.
