  BCC AE 8.1.0 – What's New
 </b>
 :
</p>
<p>
 • Improved render peformance for 3D objects filters on Windows.
</p>
<p>
 • Added support for the five 3DO Objects filters to Premiere CS6 and higher (previously only available in AE): 3D Extruded Text, 3D Extruded EPS, 3D Extruded Spline, Layer Deformer, Type on Text.
</p>
<p>
 • The new particle filters now support Depth of Field (Particle Emitter 3D, Organic Strands, Wild Cards, Particle Array 3D, Pin Art 3D).
</p>
<p>
 • Lens Flare 3D now supports using AE mask path shapes to obscure the lens flare.
</p>
<p>
 • Lens Flare 3D now provides a Scale by Distance option when using the AE comp camera which allows the light to scale automatically as the distance between the comp camera and and light source changes.
</p>
<p>
 • Improved render quality in Stage Light.
</p>
<p>
 • Improved performance and render quality with the antialiasing modes in the new particle filters. Using the High quality mode now renders twice as fast as previously and with better quality making it largely unnecessary to use the Higher and Highest settings.
</p>
<p>
 • Motion Tracker workflow improvements benefiting AE and Premiere including a much cleaner workflow in Premiere which no longer requires rendering to generate the tracker data. Additionally a Clear Render Cache button was added to allowing a more convenient method to clear the host cache of frames containing rendered tracker messages. See the Motion Tracker help docs for AE and Premiere for more details on the new workflow.
</p>
<p>
 • Improved integration with AE camera/light/layer parenting properties allowing the creation of more sophisticated animation rigs for particle emitters.
</p>
<p>
 • Enabled support for TGA image formats in Pan and Zoom in 64bit hosts (was already present in 32bit hosts).
</p>
<p>
 • Enabled support for PSD image formats in Pan and Zoom on windows hosts.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed problem with Wild Card displaying the wrong frames in the second half of interlaced clips when field rendering.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed cases where the Compare Mode didn't display accurately when using the Pixel Chooser.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed incorrect rendering in Damaged TV.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed dark fringes around alpha objects when using Radial Blur.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed compositing errors when LED was applied to alpha objects.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed problems with text entry in 3D Objects filters when set to Right Flush / Force Justification.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed problems with Add blend modes in the new particle filters.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed jitter artifacts in Optical Stabilizer when field rendering with interlaced source footage.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed jumps in Snow animation.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed problems with the Optical Stabilizer analyzation failing to start when clicking Analyze in HD projects in Premiere.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed sporadic instability in the new particle filters in Premiere hosts.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed flickering output when selecting a single channel in the integrated Beat Reactor.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed Problems in MacOS 10.7 with Pan and Zoom referencing external media in 32bit projects.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed problems with incorrect menus or unexpected behavior when using the preset popup menus in Mac AE CS6 with 3D Objects filters.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed problem where the auto scale in Opticial Stabilizer did not adjust correctly if the Smoothing Range was changed after the initial analyzation.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed problem where hitting the space bar would sometimes generate two spaces instead of one in Extruded Text on Windows.
</p>
<p>
 • Fixed occasional incorrect render on the last frame of a Pan and Zoom animation if Ease Out was set to 0.
</p>
<p>
 • Numerous additional bug fixes.

  BCC AE 8.1.0 - Known Issues and Limitations
 </b>
 :
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  Known issues that are specific to Mac OS:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • When taking an AE project that uses BCC 3D Objects created on Mac CS4 or earlier, and opening that project in CS5 (Mac or Windows) Texture Files or Bump Files referenced in the 3D Objects' materials will not be found by the plugins and will need to be manually reset to get the effect to appear as expected. (In this case a warning is displayed.)
</p>
<p>
 • When using the 3D Objects category of effects on Mac OS, enabling the "Transparent Object" checkbox will result in the object becoming fully transparent (so this feature is not useful on Mac).
</p>
<p>
 • Stage Light renders black on Mac AE CS4 only.
</p>
<p>
 • Previewing BCC Damaged TV to RAM in AE CS4, particularly on older graphics cards, can lead to low memory warnings. Increasing the reserved memory in the AE preferences may help work around this problem.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 <b>
  Known issues that apply to both Mac OS and Windows OS:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • Fixes to the Add blend mode in the new particle filters may cause previously created projects which used the Add blend mode to render with lighter colors in regions where particles overlap.
</p>
<p>
 • In the new particle filters, particulary Particle Array 3D, particles with the same Z depth can sometimes exhibit clipping errors when Depth of Field is enabled.
</p>
<p>
 • In BCC Particle Emitter 3D the interaction layer is not working accurately with 3D Text layers unless they are precomposed at comp dimensions.
</p>
<p>
 • Some BCC OGL filters can cause unexpected behavior when scrubbing on screen overlay widgets in 4K comps.
</p>
<p>
 • In BCC Particle Emitter 3D, changing the Blend Mode in the Spawn group can unexpectedly affect the main particle compositing.
</p>
<p>
 • In BCC Stage Light animating the Smoke Speed parameter can lead to jerkiness or unexpected motion in the smoke field. As a temporary workaround this parameter should not be keyframed.
</p>
<p>
 • Use of the Lines settings in BCC Damaged TV can generate bad pixels in some scenarios.
</p>
<p>
 • Using time reversal on a precomped layer containing BCC Looper can cause unexpected behavior.
</p>
<p>
 • As part of the new Motion Tracker workflow, if you change the tracker search width, target width, color space, or accuracy after an initial tracking pass, you must now reset the tracker data with the reset button in the tracker banner before starting a second tracker pass. (This is not necessary if only the tracker point picker location has changed.)
</p>
<p>
 • In 3D Objects filters when using the Comp Light Spotlight and AE Camera, the spotlight cone gets larger when viewed at lower resolutions so this feature should be previewed at full rez.
</p>
<p>
 • In Type on Text the Line Leading in the text entry preview window does not accurately match up with the leading in the rendered result and the leading may need to be adjusted to generate the desired final render.
</p>
<p>
 • Several render quality improvements were made to Film Glow, particularly when applied to content with an alpha channel. As a result of these improvements, previously saved Film Glow projects may render somewhat differently when opened in 8.0.1 or higher.
</p>
<p>
 • Due to fixes in random number generator pattern differences between mac and win projects, you may see differences between random patterns in saved BCC7 projects when opened in BCC8. The overall “look” will remain the same but the details of the random patterns may shift.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 <b>
  Known issues that are specific to Premiere Pro:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 • Versions of Premiere Pro prior to CS6 have problems getting the correct frame with filters that access layers at alternate times when applied to trimmed clips. Adobe resolved this issue in Premiere Pro CS6 but in prior versions of Premiere Pro you may need to export trimmed sections and reimport them as untrimmed in order for time based features such as Optical Stabilizer, Motion Key, or the Motion Tracker to work properly.
</p>
<p>
 • In Premiere Pro only, enabling the Use Individual Layers control in BCC Pin Art will generate a rendered error message.
</p>
<p>
 • Currently the only way to select from the list of installed image shapes in the new particle filters on Windows Premiere Pro is to use the prev/next arrow keys to step through the list which is inconvenient due to the length of the list. Using a host layer to define a particle shape can prove a convenient workaround.
</p>
<p>
 • Preset banner popup menus do not work in Premiere Pro on Windows. Presets must be loaded with the Load (L) button instead.
</p>
<p>
 • Features that make reference to host cameras, lights, 3D layers, or mask paths are relevant only when running in After Effects and should be ignored in Premiere Pro hosts.
</p>
<p>
 • Stacking multiple BCC filters on a single clip when one of those filters accesses frames at other times (such as for temporal blurring or time remapping) can lead to performance degradation or psuedo-hanging. It is recommended that BCC filters which access frames at alternate times should be applied singly.
</p>
