<p>Additonal notes on working with BCC in Vegas can be found here - <a title="Working in Sony Vegas" href="/documentation/continuum/bcc-overview-in-sony-vegas/" target="_blank"> Working in Sony Vegas </a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b> BCC OFX 9 for Sony Vegas supports the following host environments: </b></p>
<p>Windows 7 64, Windows 8 64:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sony Vegas 11 (version 595 or higher) - 64 bit only</li>
<li>Sony Vegas 12</li>
<li>Sony Vegas 13</li>
<li>Sony Movie Studio Platinum 13</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> BCC 9.x for Sony Vegas - Compatibility Notes </strong> :</p>
<p>While in general your previously saved projects should render identically in the newer version, bug fixes and quality improvements can sometimes change the look of older projects. While every effort is made to ensure project compatibility, the following notable areas may see some change to the look of previously saved projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>In all wipe-style transitions which contain Border options, the opacity of the border elements fades automatically at the start/end of transitions (except in manual mode) to fix potential jumps in the renders at the start and end of the transitions when border offsets were non-zero.</li>
<li>The largely unnecessary Hold In / Hold Out parameters were removed from the Animation Tuning group in all transitions which could cause changes in the transition timing in the unlikely event these parameters had been changed from their defaults.</li>
<li>As part of the major performance optimizations implemented in Damaged TV for BCC9, some details such as the randomization patterns can render differently although the overall feel of the effect should remain the same.</li>
<li>The Pixel Chooser and Motion Tracker were removed from Swish Pan since they did not make sense in the context of a transition. In the unlikely event that these controls were used in previously saved projects, the pixel chooser and motion tracker settings would be ignored in new renders.</li>
<li>Numerous quality improvements and bug fixes were made to new particle filters (Particle Emitter, Particle Array 3D, Pin Art 3D, Organic Strands, and Wild Cards) which may result in appearance changes in some saved projects.</li>
<li>Stage Light has undergone major upgrades to its render quality which may result in appearance changes in some saved projects.</li>
<li>Fixes to the way the Motion Tracker Offset is applied to Oval or Rectangle Pixel Chooser shapes may require manually re-tweaking the Offset parameters in saved projects.</li>
<li>The Motion Tracker has been removed from all BCC transitions for improved clarity and usability. In the unlikely event that a transition was used with the Motion Tracker in a saved project, the motion path will need to be reconfigured manually.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> BCC 9.0.2D for Sony Vegas - Known Issues and Limitations </strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>26878 - In BCC particle filters if you change a keyframe for a parameter whose full animation history affects the particle rendering (such as the keyframed history of the particle emitter location), any previously cached frames that are more than one keyframe away from the changed keyframe will not be automatically recalculated. This only happens if the keyframe in question is edited in the lanes or curves view of the animation timeline. If the parameter value is changed with the parameter control directly then this stale cache problem does not occur. To force cached frames to be recalculated you can make a tiny change to some parameter in the effect which will refresh all frames without changing the overall look of the effect.</li>
<li>26847 - In Optical Stabilizer incorrect stabilization can result if a clip's trim points are edited after the clip has been partially or completely analyzed. As a temporary workaround you can adjust the trim points prior to analyzing the clip or you can force re-analyzation after changing the trim points by increasing the Stabilization Samples parameter in the Optical Flow group by a small amount.</li>
<li>26750 - The Beat Reactor audio graph becomes less accurate as the Frequency Resolution is increased to high values. Use lower values near the default setting of 32 as a workaround.</li>
<li>26659 - In Vegas 11 only - The Beat Reactor audio graph shifts by a noticeable amount when resolution is less than full. Set the preview resolution to full when setting up Beat Reactor clips to avoid any discrepancies between preview and final renders or switch to a newer version of Vegas.</li>
<li>30360 - Page Turn does not work as when applied as a one sided transitions to the front of a clip. This can generally be worked around by applying the effect as a VideoFx transition with media separated on different tracks if necessary rather than applying as a true transition.</li>
<li>23519 - If a project is saved after loading a preset in the BCC effect controls and this preset is removed from the system (or the project is copied to another system that doesn't contain this preset), then when the project is reopened the UI for the effect does not appear correctly. This can be worked around by reinstating the missing preset and relaunching vegas or by saving the current filter settings as a Vegas preset, deleting the filter, and loading that vegas preset in a new instance of the filter.</li>
<li>26796 - BCC Stars will occasionally exhibit horizontal bands of artifacts in the star field and galaxy controls.</li>
<li>27975 - In order to workaround a problem with parameters being incorrectly disabled in Vegas 11.683, all enabling/disabling of parameters has been turned off in that specific version of Vegas and parameters remain enabled at all times.</li>
<li>26068 - In BCC Particle Emitter 3D, changing the Blend Mode in the Spawn group can unexpectedly affect the main particle compositing.</li>
<li>27591 - As part of the new Motion Tracker workflow, if you change the tracker search width, target width, color space, or accuracy after an initial tracking pass, you must now reset the tracker data with the reset button in the tracker banner before starting a second tracker pass. (This extra step is not necessary if the tracker point picker location has changed.)</li>
<li>25867 - In BCC Type On Text the Line Leading in the text entry preview window does not accurately match up with the leading in the rendered result, and the leading may need to be adjusted to generate the desired final render.</li>
<li>29533 - The apply modes Boost Expo 1, 2, and 50/50 mix do not give the expected result in Grunge.</li>
<li>29777 - In Grunge the Edge Offset control in the Chromatic Aberration group is not working as designed.</li>
<li>30261 - In some but not all BCC effects the UI may not accurately reflect which parameters should be enabled and disabled when an effect is first applied, but toggling any checkbox or menu parameter will force the UI state to refresh.</li>
<li>30571 + 30572 - Fast Film Process can show instability or render with black frames on some NVidia cards with the 340.52 driver.  Reverting to an earlier driver such as 333.11 may provide a temporary workaround.</li>
<li>30613 - Flicker Fixer - When using the Key/Mask controls the intensity of the flicker correction is only half as strong as it should be, even in regions that should be fully corrected.</li>
<li>30351 - Pan and Zoom - Preview Mode rectangle widgets don’t match the final result exactly when using 3D Mode with non-square PAR comps.  Settings which tend to produce more exaggerated 3D perspective will increase the relative amount of difference between the preview widget and the final result.</li>
<li>30395 - Combining 3D Objects filters with other OpenGL accelerated BCC filters such as Lens Flare 3D or Grunge can occasionally cause render errors or instability due to lack of hardware resources depending on host resource use, graphics card capabilities, and BCC 4K preference settings.</li>
<li>30378 - Fast Film Glow Dissolve - The View Ease Curve preview mode doesn’t display properly.</li>
</ul>
