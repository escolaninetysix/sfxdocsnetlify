<p> </p>
<p><strong>BCC OFX 10.x Compatibility Notes:</strong><br> While in general your previously saved projects should render identically in the newer version, bug fixes and quality improvements can sometimes change the look of older projects. While every effort is made to ensure project compatibility, the following notable areas may see some change to the look of previously saved projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>3D Objects Extrusion Styles now scale with text point size but this can in some cases cause different scaling when opening saved projects which might require readjustment.</li>
<li>The BCC Motion Tracker in OFX hosts will continue to render previously saved motion tracker analysis passes and it will continue to support loading externally generated tracker data files such as those exported from mocha, but conducting new BCC Motion Tracker analysis passes is disabled in OFX hosts other than Vegas in order to ensure full cooperation with host multi-threading requirements.</li>
<li>Rays Dissolve - a fix to the Region Animation rotation control will cause the region size to appear slightly larger when opening saved projects which used this Region Animation option. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BCC OFX 10.0.2 - Known Issues and Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Title Studio Plugin Mac - Menu Bar doesn't update back when toggling apps until you cancel or apply from Title Studio UI. [1539]</li>
<li>BCC Motion Blur now includes an Advanced optical flow option which uses OpenCL hardware assisted rendering to implement a more sophisticated (and more computationally intensive) motion vector analysis.  The performance of the Advance mode varies widely from one graphics card to another and if you see reduced performance or unexpected results when using the Advanced option it is recommended that you switch to the Simple mode on that card. [706 + 1094]</li>
<li>Title Studio - The Frame Cache is not automatically Purged when you manually change the PAR (pixel aspect ratio). [1964]</li>
<li>Title Studio - Some C4D files show inaccurate colors or blocky shape geometries. [2271]</li>
<li>Title Studio - Japanese Localization is not working in all UI elements. [2571]</li>
<li>Match Grain - Locking Sample control does not work in Resolve, but samples can still be loaded from the grain sample menu. [2558]</li>
<li>Flicker Fixer fails to fully eliminate flicker in float bitdepth projects when method set to Frame Analysis or Temporal Smooth YCC.  When working with float images an alternate smoothing method should be chosen.  [2388]</li>
<li>Point picker labels that appear over the image can be too small and appear malformed on some Retina displays. [2574]</li>
</ul>
