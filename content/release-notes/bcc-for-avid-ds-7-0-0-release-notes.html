  Known Issues/Limitations:
 </b>
</p>
<ul>

  At random, It is possible that the mouse cursor would disappear when adjusting some Slider parameters in Effect’s UI. To avoid this we suggest setting it in Classic Mode instead of Relative Mode. We are working with Avid to resolve this problem.

  At random, Thumbwheels for certain parameters may not show up. Generally re-sizing the Effects’ UI Window fixes this problem. We are working with Avid to resolve this problem.

  Some thumbwheels can be coarse in updating the values. We are working with Avid to resolve this problem.
