 Introduction
 <a name="bookmark34">
 </a>
 ‌
</h1>
<p>
 Welcome to Boris Final Effects Complete 5.0.1 for FxPlug. FEC FxPlug is a plug-ins package with 109 powerful visual effects filters re-designed for Apple's FxPlug plug-in architecture, providing seamless integration with
 <i>
  <b>
   Apple Final Cut Pro
  </b>
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  <b>
   Motion.
  </b>
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 The heart of Final Effects Complete is its ability to generate full-featured two-dimensional and three-dimensional particle animations including ball action, explosions, distortions, jet trails, hair, liquid mercury distortions, spotlights, and color transitions. FEC FxPlug also delivers a complete range of unique auto-animating transitions. Ranging from graceful blur dissolves to radical warps; FEC FxPlug lets you easily create dramatic effects with minimal adjustment.

  <p>
   Most FEC filters contain a
   <b>
    PixelChooser
   </b>
   that include standard pixel chooser functions (as in BCC). Several of those filters take that model even further by offering powerful new selective filtering apply modes. The Pixel Chooser allows the user to create a matte from a geometric shape, and/or any of the channels of the input layer. The usage of this matte varies from filter to filter and is typically used to matte the output of the effect with the input.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many of the filters have more creative uses allowing you to make effects that could not be made by applying the filter and matting it in a separate operation. Many of the included filter presets demonstrate the use of the Pixel Chooser. Documentation on the use of the Pixel Chooser can be found by clicking the
   <b>
    Help
   </b>
   button at the top of the Pixel Chooser parameter group in any filter that contains a Pixel Chooser.

   What’s New in FEC 5.0.1 FxPlug
  </h1>
  <p>
   Since the release of FEC 5.0 for FxPlug, the following have been added to version 5.0.1.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Seven new Transition plug-ins (with presets):
  </p>
  <ul id="l3">
   <li>
    <p class="s3">
     Blur Dissolve, Lens Wipe, Spherize Wipe, Griddler Wipe, Pin Wipe, Slant Wipe, and Rain Wipe.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The
   <b>
    Animation Tuning
   </b>
   capabilities of the new transitions have been added to the existing FEC transition plug-ins. These parameters are responsible for fine-tuning the pace and timing of auto-animated transitions, as well as remapping and holding the effect using
   <i>
    <b>
     Ease In / Ease Out
    </b>
   </i>
   sliders.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The FEC Spot Frame bug has been fixed – Artifacts sometimes appear along the frame boundary when the Light Intensity is high or when certain Frame Keying options are used.

   Presets are only compatible with the filter in which they were created. However, PixelChooser presets load even if they were saved from another filter's Pixel Chooser parameter group.

  <p>
   Presets do not save Motion Tracker data. Loading a preset does not overwrite existing motion tracker data. This allows you to select the preset after you have finished Motion Tracking.
  </p>
  <h2>

   </a>
   Loading Presets
  </h2>
  <p>
   To load a previously saved filter settings file, you must first apply the same filter to your media. Then select a preset from the popup menu or click the
   <b>
    L
   </b>
   or Load button, which will open a dialog box allowing you to load a file. The saved parameter settings are recalled and applied to your effect.

   Saving Presets
   <a name="bookmark40">

  </h2>
  <p>
   After you apply a Boris filter and adjust the filter parameters, you can save the parameter settings by clicking the
   <b>
    S
   </b>
   or Save button. A dialog box allows you to name and save the file. Preset names are limited to alphanumeric characters. Special characters in a preset name may result in the preset being dimmed in the Load preset list.
  </p>
  <p>
   Saving an FEC setting creates a static effect. Each filter has its own settings folder created when you install Final Effects Complete. We strongly recommend that you save files in the default location. Otherwise, the filter may not be able to locate them when you try to load a setting.

   If you want to move a preset that you have created to another system, we suggest the following steps:

  <ol id="l8">
   <li>
    <p>
     Load the preset.

   <li>

    <p>
     Move the preset to the desktop of the other system by any means necessary.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Load the preset from the desktop in the second system using the 'L' button.
    </p>

     Save the preset into its proper folder using the 'S' button.

   Final Effects Complete filters offer an optional realtime capability inside of Final Cut Pro. Using these specific filters will enable you to playback a realtime preview of what your final effect will look like without having to render the clip or sequence. Please see the Final Cut Pro documentation for more information about realtime effects.

   Previewing FEC RT filters in realtime requires you to be in
   <b>
    Unlimited RT Mode,
   </b>
   but they will still work in any mode.

   The “Mix” slider located at the bottom of each FEC filter panel is part of Apple’s host UI, therefore isn’t mentioned in the Boris FEC filter help docs. “Mix with Original” is FEC’s mix control and will be saved in FEC filter presets, Apple’s “Mix” will not.
