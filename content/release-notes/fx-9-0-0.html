  Key Features
 </strong>
</p>
<h4>
 <a name="bookmark3">
 </a>
 Support for 16-Bit Color
</h4>
<p>
 Boris software now supports 16-bit color image processing; it supports trillions of colors, which results in smoother gradients and more precise color correction.
</p>
<h4>
 <a name="bookmark4">
 </a>
 New User Interface
</h4>
<p>
 This version of Boris FX incorporates NLE look and feel for smooth user interaction and transition, automatic data updates, mini Timeline in the Composite window, and popular “Sticky” and “Magnetic” windows.
</p>
<h4>
 <a name="bookmark5">
 </a>
 New BCC Filters with Custom Preset Manager
</h4>
<p>
 The original filter effects in Boris FX have been replaced with the more powerful filters from the Boris Continuum Complete package, plus new filters added. The list of new filters includes blurs, particles, glows, distortions, volumetric lighting, film effects, keys and matting, and procedural generators such as snow, rain, and clouds.
</p>
<h4>
 <a name="bookmark6">
 </a>
 New FEC Filters
</h4>
<p>
 Several filters from the Final Effects Complete package have been added to Boris FX, including FEC Hair, FEC Drizzle, and FEC Glass, to name a few.
</p>
<h4>
 <a name="bookmark7">
 </a>
 Keyframe Effects Directly in the Composite Window
</h4>
<p>
 Now you can generate keyframed effects right within the Composite window, without the need to see the master Timelime. Select an element within the Composite window by clicking on it, and the master keyframes associated with that object appear in the mini Timeline included in the Composite window. Keyframes can be added and directly manipulated right in the mini Timeline.
</p>
<h4>
 <a name="bookmark8">
 </a>
 New Electronic Help System
</h4>
<p>
 Boris FX includes a brand new fully searchable electronic Help reference system, so that you can spend more time creating effects and less time figuring out how to do it.
</p>
<h2>
 <strong>
  Image Processing
 </strong>
 <br>
</h2>
<p>
 Boris software now works with both 8-bit-per-channel and 16-bit-per-channel media; 16-bit- per-channel mode makes a larger range of colors available. When you work with high- resolution images that use a narrow range of colors, such as gradients for film effects or HDTV output, 16-bit-per-channel mode means that transitions between colors display less banding, and more detail is preserved.
</p>

   Modeless Options Palette
  </h4>
  <p>
   A new Options Palette allows you to adjust many settings that were previously available in the Preferences window. This makes working with functions, such as grids and guides, an easier task. The Options Palette is a floating window; you can leave it open at all times, and the changes you make in it are instantaneous. The options palette is available for Vector Trace, Splines, Grids and Guides, Keyframe Interpolation, Keyframe Generator, and Timecode. The following example shows the Grids and Guides tab.

  </p>
  <p>
   Artist’s Poster creates a posterized effect by reducing the image to eight “pure” colors (Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, and White) and processing each color separately. At its default settings the filter outputs the NTSC-safe color that is closest to each of these eight colors.

   <a name="bookmark18">

   BCC Blur
  </h4>
  <p>
   Blur emulates the look of shooting in soft focus or with lens diffusion. This filter allows you to blur the horizontal and vertical components of the image independently.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the source image is opaque, selecting the Opaque Source checkbox can speed rendering and preview times. If your source is partially transparent, deselect this option for best results.

  <p>
   Horizontal Blur and Vertical Blur control the amount of blur in each direction. Increasing these values increases the amount of blur that is applied to the image. If the Lock Blur checkbox is checked, Horizontal Blur sets the blur amount in both directions.

   BCC Boost Blend
  </h4>
  <p>
   Boost Blend is a compositing filter that blends two independent layers in a composition and adjusts contrast in the blended pixels. Unlike most transfer modes, Boost Blend adjusts the mix only where the source and blend layers are different. Boost Blend is especially useful when you composite an image over itself and do not want the Apply mode to affect areas where the blended pixels are identical to the source pixels. The PixelChooser provides additional control over the selection of pixels to adjust.

   BCC Color Choker Filter
  </h4>
  <p>
   This filter independently chokes the red, green, and blue channels of an image. It is intended for use with opaque images and does not use the alpha channel. The controls are very similar to those in the Composite Choker filter, except that the latter filter affects alpha. Use this filter to create effects in which color details have more contrast and are softer. In the default choke mode.

   BCC Color Match simplifies the process of matching the color or luma values of two clips in the timeline. For instance, if two clips with different lighting conditions are spliced together, the clips color and luma values will differ. Match Color automates the process of removing or balancing the difference between the two clips by setting color or luma values for the highlight, mid, and shadow areas of the image.

   The Gaussian Blur filter implements a popular blur algorithm that produces smoother blurs but takes more time to render than the Basic Blur filter. Gaussian Blur softens the image by averaging each pixel with its neighboring pixels. The word “Gaussian” refers to the bell- shaped curve commonly used in statistical analysis. The shape of this curve determines how much each averaged pixel contributes to the output.

   Levels Gamma provides options for adjusting contrast and eliminating noise in your image. Video shot at night or in poorly lit settings often contains noise in the dark areas. Increasing Input Black removes this noise by treating all areas darker than the Input Black setting as black. Washed out or overexposed images do not contain the full range of levels. Increasing Input Black and/or decreasing Input White can boost the contrast of the image.

   BCC Motion Blur Filter
  </h4>
  <p>
   The BCC Motion Blur filter creates a realistic blur on the motion in an image, simulating the effect of shooting a moving object on film. The blur is based on the motion of the pixels in the image. For example, you could apply the Motion Blur filter to a clip of a speeding car and thecar’s motion would blur while the background would not. The blur is most pronounced when the object moves quickly and more subtle when it moves slowly. Motion blur is not visible if the image is static.

   The MultiTone Mix filter uses the source image’s color, luma, or alpha information to create a toned image that uses up to five independent colors. MultiTone Mix works by creating a color map based on a specific channel in the source image, then replacing each color range in the map with a new color.

   Posterize reduces the number of colors in the image by independently reducing the number of discrete levels in each color channel.

   Fast Flipper flips or mirrors your image. You can flip your image vertically or horizontally, or define an invisible mirror line that mirrors your image in various directions. You can also blend the mirror line to produce a smoother transition between the original and mirrored images. Resampling is on a pixel-for-pixel basis, so the filter is fast and no quality is lost.

   The results obtained with the edge filters vary depending on the media to which the filter is applied and the exact settings used. Because they create edge effects by emphasizing differences between adjacent pixels, edge filters are very sensitive to parameter adjustments. Often a very small change in a parameter can dramatically affect the result.

   BCC Deinterlace Filter

   The BCC Deinterlace filter converts interlaced video clips into progressive-scan frames, such as footage shot on film. Deinterlace can render “simulated TeleCine” style by adding pulldown. This filter can also convert 29.97fps NTSC video into 24fps film-style frames.

   BCC DeNoise
  </h4>
  <p>
   The BCC DeNoise filter removes unwanted pixel noise from an image. DeNoise is especially useful when working with archival materials, as it lets you correct dark areas that show artifacts from film emulsion or video compression. You may also want to use the BCC DeNoise filter when resizing 4:3 images to 16:9 aspect ratio.
  </p>
  <p>
   The BCC DeNoise filter distinguishes between moving areas and areas that are static. This allows the filter to selectively remove noise only from static areas. This preserves the full detail of areas that are in motion.
  </p>
  <p>
   DeNoise uses temporal and spacial smoothing to eliminate the artifacts, based on alternate frames in the video. Since the smoothing algorithm is based on a sequence of frames, it is difficult to show the effects of this filter in a still image.

   BCC Glow
  </h4>
  <p>
   The Glow filter uses a blur to create a glowing effect, highlighting the edges in the chosen channel. This filter is different from the Glow filter included in earlier versions of BCC; that filter has been renamed BCC Rough Glow. If you are creating a new effect, you should use the BCC Glow filter.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Glow finds the brighter parts of an image and then brightens those and surrounding pixels to create a diffuse, glowing halo. The Glow can also simulate overexposure of brightly lit objects. You can base the glow on either the original colors of the image or on a chosen channel. You can also use the Glow to create a gradient glow between two colors and to create multicolor effects with looping.

   BCC Halftone Filter
  </h4>
  <p>
   The BCC Halftone filter simulates the look of printed material by converting the image to simulated halftone dots. Print images are comprised of a rosette pattern of colored ink dots. To avoid moiré or interference patterns, the dots are printed at different angles; this process is known as halftone screening. This is also used in the art world as a creative process such as the work produced by Lichtenstein.

   The BCC Median filter makes each pixel look like the majority of its neighboring pixels. It produces a smeary look, but with sharp edges (at neighborhood boundaries). The Median filter also reduces noise by eliminating “spikes”, or pixels that are very different from their neighbors (also referred to as “salt and pepper noise”).

   The results obtained with the edge filters vary depending on the media to which the filter is applied and the exact settings used. Because they create edge effects by emphasizing differences between adjacent pixels, edge filters are very sensitive to parameter adjustments. Often a small change in a parameter setting can dramatically affect the result.

   The BCC Caustics filter can be used to simulate the effect of light refracting through a surface of water and projected onto a surface (like moving water ripple reflections on a pool bottom). You can use this filter to create many types of effects where rays emanate from a point and are reflected or refracted by a curved surface. For example, you could use this filter to generate moving plasma fields, smoky particle effects, waves in a pool, or animating geometric patterns.

   The BCC Rays Generator creates a ray burst effect. The rays can act as a filter on a clip or layer or generate a ray layer. The Rays effect is comprised of two discrete elements, the rays and the glow. The filter provides controls for adjusting each element individually. The rays can be composited over the source image, or you can generate a completely synthetic image.
