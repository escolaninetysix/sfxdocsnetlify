   What's new with BCC 7.0.7.4
  </b>
 </u>
 :
</p>
<p>
 â€¢ This version of BCC 7 resolves an issue with moving projects forward from BCC 6 into BCC 7. The problem manifested itself in the form of an error message that would appear in a project where a BCC 6 3D Extruded Text filter had been used. The problem was related to the texture map pop-up and the font selection. The error will no longer appear when using this version of the product.

 This update is recommended for all BCC AE users.
