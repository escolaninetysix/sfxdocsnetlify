  BCC 8.0.1 for Sony Vegas - Known Issues and Limitations:
 </b>
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 • Pan and Zoom supports TGA images in the 32bit versions but not in the 64bit versions so when opening 32bit projects in 64bit applications the TGA files will not be recognized. As a temporary workaround the TGA files can be converted to another format such as JPG/TIFF and then reselected with the External File button.
</p>
<p>
 • In BCC particle filters if you change a keyframe for a parameter whose full animation history affects the particle rendering (such as the keyframed history of the particle emitter location), any previously cached frames that are more than one keyframe away from the changed keyframe will not be automatically recalculated. This only happens if the keyframe in question is edited in the lanes or curves view of the animation timeline. If the parameter value is changed with the parameter control directly then this stale cache problem does not occur. To force cached frames to be recalculated you can make a tiny change to some paremeter in the effect which will refresh all frames without changing the overall look of the effect.
</p>
<p>
 • In Particle Emitter 3D keyframing the Wind X/Y/Z sliders can yield unexpected movement of the particles and as a temporary workaround these parameters should remain static.
</p>
<p>
 • In Optical Stabilizer incorrect stabilization can result if a clip's trim points are edited after the clip has been partially or completely analyzed. As a temporary workaround you can adjust the trim points prior to analyzing the clip or you can force reanalyzation after changing the trim points by increasing the Stabilization Samples parameter in the Optical Flow group by 1 unit.
</p>
<p>
 • In Optical Stabilizer when using the Smoothing mode with AutoScale enabled, black borders can appear on the edges of the clip if the Smoothing Range is modified after the clip is analyzed. As a temporary workaround you can set the Smoothing Range prior to analyzation or you can force reanalyzation after changing the Smoothing Range by increasing the Stabilization Samples parameter in the Optical Flow group by 1 unit.
</p>
<p>
 • The Beat Reactor audio graph becomes less accurate as the Freqeuncy Resolution is increased to high values. As a temporary workaround use low values near the default setting of 32.
</p>
<p>
 • The Beat Reactor audio graph shifts by a noticable amount when resoltuion is less than full. Set the preview resolution to full when setting up Beat Reactor clips to avoid any discrepancies between preview and final renders.
</p>
<p>
 • Some BCC transitions do not work as when applied as one sided transitions to the front of a clip or when applied to clips with alpha channels. This can generally be worked around by applying the effect as a VideoFx transiton with media separated on different tracks if necessary rather than applying as a true transition.
</p>
<p>
 • If a project is saved after loading a preset in the BCC effect controls and this preset is removed from the system (or the project is copied to another system that doesn't contain this preset), then when the project is reopened the UI for the effect does not appear correctly. This can be worked around by reinstating the missing preset and relaunching vegas or by saving the settings as a Vegas preset, deleting the filter, and loading that vegas preset in a new instance of the filter.
</p>
<p>
 • In filters with more than one Motion Tracker point (e.g. BCC Witness Protection), saving/loading the motion tracker data only works for the first tracker point.
</p>
<p>
 • Filters which access frames at alternate times such as the Time category filters can produce unexpected jitter when applied to clips that have more horizontal frame aspect than the project's frame aspect.
</p>
<p>
 • BCC Posterize Time can show interlacing artifacts when applied in interlaced projects. As a workaround you can prerender Posterize Time clips in progressive projects which will produce correctly posterized frames when reimported into interlaced projects.
</p>
<p>
 • BCC Stars will occasionally exhibit horizontal bands of artifacts in the star field and galaxy controls.
</p>
<p>
 • In BCC Particle Systems (but not in Particle Emitter 3D), particles are rendered as if progressive even when in interlaced projects thus yielding less fluid motion in fast moving particle animations.
</p>
<p>
 • BCC LED shows occasional mis-colored dots on Quadro FX 3500 cards.
</p>
<p>
 • The Boost Exponential apply modes can show artifacts in Velocity remap. Other apply modes should be used as a temporary workaround.
</p>
<p>
 • Using Image Collection shapes to define particle shapes in Particle Array and Pin Art can show clipping artifacts if the particle size is large and the apply mode is normal. Use alternate particle shapes, smaller particle sizes, and/or the Add apply mode as a temporary workaround.

 Using
 <b>
  BCC 2 to 1 Transforms
 </b>
 :
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  In Vegas Pro
  <b>
   for an effect to be able to access an alternate video layer
  </b>
  (a layer other than the layer the effect is applied to)
  <b>
   for processing it needs to be applied on a per track basis as a 2 to 1 Transform.
  </b>
  Boris Continuum for Sony Vegas Pro currently offers the following filters as 2 to 1 Transforms:
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Edge treatment for keying and alpha effects (uses a softened area of the background to composite on foreground):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Light Wrap
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Composite effects (combine layers according to blend modes, allow for mixing multiple blend modes, using user defined regions and image based channels to define blend area etc.):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Boost Blend
 </li>
 <li>
  Composite
 </li>
 <li>
  RGB Blend
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Displacement effects (can be used to access the layer below the filter layer as a displacement map):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Displacement Map
 </li>
 <li>
  Polar Displacement
 </li>
 <li>
  Vector Displacement
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Two-Image effects (allows accessing the layer below as an alternate foreground/background layer when compositing or as an alternate particle face):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Corner Pin
 </li>
 <li>
  Match Move
 </li>
 <li>
  Wild Cards
 </li>
</ul>
