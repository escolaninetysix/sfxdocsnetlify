 BCC 6.0.5 FxPlug Release Notes
</h1>
<p class="s1">
 BCC 6.0.5 FxPlug includes a new Flicker and Shake filter, a freshly re-designed preset browser for the Boris Continuum Shaders group of filters, and important improvements and bug fixes for FCS 3 and Mac OS X 10.6
</p>
<ul id="l1">

  <p class="s1">
   BCC Flicker and Shake. This new filter is designed to synchronize randomly-animated stylistic treatments such as glows, lights, and shake for video or graphics elements. An auto-animating filter, Flicker and Shake uses bursts of synchronized Exposure, Glow, Blur, X or Y displacement, and RGB Channel offset to emulate a flicker effect that has been made popular by recent commercials and film trailers.

<h2>
 Warning about using Optical Stabilizer in Motion
</h2>
<p>
 Since the progress dialog is non-modal in Motion, it's possible to click around the UI while in the middle of the analyze process. For example, you can click the analyze button again to launch another dialog or click any of the effect parameter controls. This action can lead to instability of the application.
