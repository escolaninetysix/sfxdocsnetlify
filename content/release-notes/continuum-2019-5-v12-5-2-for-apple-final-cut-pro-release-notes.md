**Continuum 2019.5.1 (v12.5.2) for FxPlug - Known Issues and Limitations:**

* Continuum 2019.5 for FxPlug does not include support for Mocha tracking/masking, Primatte Studio, Particle Illusion, Title Studio, Optical Stabilizer, or the FX Browser at this time.
* In order to comply with host multi-threading requirements BCC Match Grain does not currently support using the Lock Sample checkbox to lock in new grain samples. You can still use Match Grain to render grain matched from an alternate clip by leaving the Lock Sample checkbox disabled, but it is not possible to use the Lock Sample checkbox to store new grain profiles permanently in grain files or presets. However, loading previously saved grain profiles or Match Grain presets will continue to work as before. \[2858\]
* Lens Flash Transition ignores Ease parameters \[CO-5719\]
