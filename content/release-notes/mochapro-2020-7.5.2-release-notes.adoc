== Introduction

These release notes accompany *Mocha Pro {revision}*.

This is a maintenance release with several defect fixes.
Release notes cover Mocha Pro, for both standalone and Plug-in versions of the product.

Documentation is available inside *Mocha Pro {revision}* by pressing the F1 key.

== Build notes

Please read the following notes carefully as they may affect efficient use of the product.

icon:exclamation-triangle[] OFX builds of the Mocha Pro Plug-in have been tested to work with Autodesk Flame 2020, The Foundry Nuke, Blackmagic Fusion Studio, HitFilm Pro, Vegas Pro and Silhouette v6+. +
Other hosts that utilize OFX may operate the Mocha Pro OFX Plug-in correctly, but at this stage they are unofficially supported and may experience problems. +
While Mocha will work in Blackmagic Resolve 16, rendering can be slow.

icon:exclamation-triangle[] Projects created with version {revision} may not be backwards compatible with earlier versions of Mocha.

icon:exclamation-triangle[] Mocha Pro 2020.5 requires macOS 10.12 or higher, but we recommend at least macOS 10.13 for GPU support.

Python is not supported in the Plug-in versions of *Mocha Pro*. This means any tools created by Python will not be functional. This includes some exports such as Silhouette shapes.

== New features in Mocha Pro 2020 v7.5.2
* *GStreamer performance improvements:* GStreamer now speeds up reading of nearby frames for some imported codecs.

== New features in Mocha Pro 2020 v7.5.1
* *Updated FBX Exports:* Camera solver exports have been updated to version 7.7.0. This also means they can be exported to recent versions of Blender.
* *Timecode Offset:* The Mocha plugin can show timecode offsets from After Effects
* *Recent Files Removal:* If a project in “recent files” does not exist, you have the option to remove it from the list.
* *OpenCL Device indexing:* Multiple GPUs or CPUs capable of OpenCL operations are now numbered to make it easier to identify and select from the OpenCL device drop down.

== New features in Mocha Pro 2020 v7.5.0
* *Better wide-perspective track handling:* Now you can track longer and at further angles without getting distorted track planes or flipped mattes.
* *Flame Gmask Tracer Support:* Mocha now exports Gmask tracer nodes with axis transforms. Tracking data is converted to 3d Axis nodes.
* *Improved Motion Blur performance:* Motion blur in mattes now renders up to 4x faster.
* *Area brush size mouse controls:* You can now adjust the size of the Area Brush by holding down the CMD or Ctrl key and dragging the mouse.
* *Area Brush Fill Gaps:* We now have a new field in the area brush toolbar to help fill gaps based on a threshold.
* *Multi-point drag edge-snap:* Drag-snapping now snaps the entire selection, rather than individual points
* *Avid interlaced support:* We now support tracking and rendering back interlaced footage in Media Composer.
* *OCIO support:* Mocha has new expansive OCIO settings for managing colorspaces in Mocha.
* *GStreamer Media Support:* Imported clips can now be handled by GStreamer instead of QuickTime. Not all media types are supported at this stage.
* *Pan/Zoom Matching:* Rendered clips the same size as the original source clip will now match panning and zooming on other clips so everything lines up
* *Original frame render view:* You can now view the source frame if a module has not rendered the current frame
* *macOS Catalina support:* Mocha is now supported on macOS Catalina.
* *Remove Render performance increases for some codecs:* Some codecs provide higher decoding performance when the frames are accessed sequentially. We’ve now changed the order of frame requests in the Remove Render to utilize this property.
* *Thread-limiter:* You can now adjust the number of threads per thread pool in preferences. This is important for restricting machines that try to utilise too many cores which can cause Mocha to crash.
* *Clean plate folders:* When saving a clean plate the last used folder is used as the destination.
* *Tablet Pressure:* Tablet pressure sensitivity can be disabled via preferences

== New features in Mocha Pro 2020 v7.0.4
There were no new features for Mocha Pro 2020 v7.0.4. This was a maintenance release to fix several defects.

== New features in Mocha Pro 2020 v7.0.3

== New features in Mocha Pro 2020 v7.0.2

* *Silhouette Shapes Export Support:* The Mocha Pro Plugin now supports Silhouette shape exports to disk (and to clipboard in Silhouette 2020.0.1)
* *Silhouette Corner Pin Export Support:* Mocha Pro now exports Silhouette tracking data to disk (and to clipboard in Silhouette 2020.0.1)
* *Silhouette/Mocha Bundle license support:* Bundles of Mocha Pro and Silhouette can now be purchased and activated with a single license key
* *Silhouette 2020 OCIO Support:* Mocha OFX plugins now sync to the Silhouette OCIO color profiles
* *OCIO viewer preferences are now saved:* OCIO viewer preferences are now saved with the project.

* *Area Brush:* Quickly paint areas to turn into splines
* *OCIO Support:* Load OCIO configs directly into Mocha

| *Bug Description:* | Attaching a corner pin node to a Mocha Pro OFX node will crash Nuke.
| *Workaround:* | 1. Execute any processing used in the OFX node: +
When using a Mocha Pro node, saving and executing any changes within the Plug-in appears to stop the crashes.
So using the node and editing the CornerPin before executing the saved changes crashes Nuke.

2. Place a processing node in-between the OFX & CornerPin nodes: +
Adding a processing node in-between the two nodes (e.g. Blur) works around the issue, as the transformation information is processed before being passed through the CornerPin node.
For example, having Mocha->Blur->CornerPin stops the process loop from crashing.

== Hardware Requirements

=== Recommended Hardware

- Processor: 3rd-generation Intel Core i7 or equivalent
- Memory: 16+ GB
- Disk: High-speed disk array or NVMe SSD
- Graphics Card: NVDIA Quadro K4000 or equivalent
- Monitor: 1920×1080 or higher
- Network: Must have an enabled network adapter (wifi or ethernet)

=== Minimal Requirements

- Processor: x86-64
- Memory: At least 4 GB
- Graphics Card: For GPU tracking, must support OpenCL 1.2, for CPU tracking, OpenGL 2.1
- Monitor: Minimum resolution 1200x800 pixels
