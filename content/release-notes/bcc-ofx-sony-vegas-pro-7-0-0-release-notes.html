 Using
 <b>
  Vegas Plug-In Manager to organize BCC Continuum effects for Vegas Pro
 </b>
 :
</p>
<p>
 There are
 <b>
  many
 </b>
 effects included in Boris Continuum 7 for Vegas Pro. Unfortunately, it is currently not possible within Vegas Pro for the Continuum effects to appear within separate categories by default. Rather by default all effects appear (in the Video FX Window) in one alpha-numeric list.
 <b>
  It is recommended to use the Vegas Pro Plug-In Manager to create related groups / categories / favorites etc. of the BCC Continuum effects
 </b>
 so they are easier to find and more efficient to work with.

 Edge treatment for keying and alpha effects (uses a softened area of the background to composite on foreground):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Light Wrap

 <b>
  Disable
 </b>
 the
 <b>
  Track On-the-Fly
 </b>
 checkbox (tracker will be applied to effect parameter in final effect output)
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Clear Render Cache
  </b>
  button
 </li>
 <li>
  In order for the motion tracker integrated into many BCC effects to work properly it must analyze the frames to be tracked sequentially from the first frame in the effect segment forward. If the “Track On-the-Fly” checkbox is enabled the motion tracker is in the analyze mode. When “Track On-the-Fly” is enabled and the motion tracker is on a frame where it has no tracking data for the preceding frame, a message will appear over the effect output image saying:
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 “Move the current-time marker to a previously tracked frame and click the Clear Render Cache button. Resume tracking from that point.”
</p>
<p>
 This can happen if the Vegas Pro timeline cursor is not on the first frame of the effect when Track On-the-Fly is first enabled or if somehow the timeline cursor jumps forward into the middle of an untracked area while Track On-the-Fly is enabled.
 <b>
  In order to do more tracking in the effect once the message has been displayed it is necessary to go to the first frame (or another frame where the message is not displayed) and click the “Clear Render Cache” button
 </b>
 before Building a Dynamic Ram Preview to begin the tracking analysis. This button will force Vegas Pro to clear it's rendered frame cache for that effect (thereby clearing the overlay message which would be misleading and interfere with tracking if it were still present).
</p>

  <b>
   Muted (disabled) video tracks above
  </b>
  effect using BCC motion tracking
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Currently BCC motion tracking analysis will not work if there is a muted video track in the timeline above the track in which the BCC effect is applied.
  </b>
  The workaround is to enable any higher video tracks when using Track On-the-Fly, or to temporarily move the BCC effect track above any muted tracks while using Track On-the Fly.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 This problem only applies to the analysis phase of motion tracking and once the analysis is finished the motion tracking result will render correctly even if there is a muted video track above the effect. BorisFX is working with Sony to resolve this in a future Vegas Pro update.

 <b>
  Using BCC Transitions
 </b>
 :
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  1-sided transitions using BCC Transitions
 </li>
 <li>
  Currently applying a BCC Transition as a 1-sided transition at the head of a video event in the Vegas Pro timeline does not work as expected. This means that when applied as a transition from [empty timeline space] to a video event a transition will not be created, and the image from lower video tracks will not be revealed. The workaround is to apply the wipe as a filter rather than a transition in this case. Applying BCC Transition effects as transitions between 2 video events or as a 1-sided transition at the end of a video event works as expected.
 </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
 <b>
  Using BCC OpenGL rendering effects
 </b>
 :
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  BCC Open GL effects applied to an image with alpha channel
 </li>
 <li>
  Some of the effects in Boris Continuum use OpenGL and the system graphics card to do the processing and rendering of the effect. Some of the BCC OpenGL effects do not preserve the transparency to allow the background to show through when applied to an image with an alpha channel (like a logo, title, key etc.) The effects which currently have this limitation are:
 </li>
 <li>
  Glint - Lens Flare Advanced
 </li>
 <li>
  Glitter - Lightning
 </li>
 <li>
  Glare - Prism
 </li>
 <li>
  Lens Flare
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 For cases where the effect can still appear as desired applied to both foreground and background (like the most common use of Lens Flares for example) the effect can be applied as a Track FX (rather than an Event FX) AFTER the composite node in the effects chain (post-composite), or it can be applied to the parent track if the background video is a compositing child track, or it can be applied as an Event FX to a pre-rendered composite after rendering the alpha effect and background to a new track, etc. BorisFX plans to address this limitation in a future update of Boris Continuum for Vegas Pro.

<p>
 Using the
 <b>
  BCC Time effects
 </b>
 :
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Muted (disabled) video tracks above BCC Time effects
 </li>
 <li>
  Boris Continuum for Sony Vegas Pro offers several effects that do processing on the image by accessing the source video at different frames than the current frame. These effects are:
 </li>
 <li>
  Jitter - Temporal Blur
 </li>
 <li>
  Jitter Basic - Time Displacement
 </li>
 <li>
  Looper - Trails
 </li>
 <li>
  Motion Blur - Trails Basic
 </li>
 <li>
  Optical Flow - Velocity Remap
 </li>
 <li>
  Posterize Time
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 These effects do not preview or render correctly if they have a muted video track above them in the Vegas Pro timeline. The workaround is to enable any higher video tracks when using these effects, or to move the effect above any muted tracks. BorisFX is working with Sony to resolve this in a future Vegas Pro update.
</p>

<p>
 <b>
  Using the BCC Distortion effects
 </b>
 :
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  BCC Distortion effects can change appearance when switching prevew resolutions
 </li>
 <li>
  In some cases Boris Continuum for Sony Vegas Pro effects can change appearance noticeably when switching the resolution of the Vegas Pro Video Preview Window. This issue can be particularly apparent with BCC Distortion effects like Bulge, Displacement Map, Polar Displacement, Ripple, Turbulence, Vector Displacement, and Wave. If the Video Preview Window has been at a reduced resolution (Half or Quarter resolution) for the entire session without previewing the project at Full resolution, then these effects can look different once they are previewed at Full resolution. The way they appear when previewing at Full resolution is the way they will appear at final render. To avoid this problem simply make sure to have set the Video Preview Window to Full resolution sometime in the session before working with these effects.
 </li>
</ul>
