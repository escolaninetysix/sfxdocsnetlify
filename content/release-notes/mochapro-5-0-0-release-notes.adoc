:Revision:  mocha Pro 5.0.0

== Introduction
These release notes accompany *{revision}*.

Documentation is available inside *{revision}* by pressing the F1 key.

== New Features Guide
This release contains many new features, including:

* GPU-Enhanced Tracking
* Redesigned Insert Module
* Copy and Pasting Contours
* New Import: Silhouette Projects
* New Export: Silhouette Shapes
* New export: Fusion Shapes
* Improved Export for Adobe After Effects shapes
* Vastly Improved Python API (see Python guide for more details)
* Built-in Python script editor
* Command line tools to render and export files (See Python guide for more details)
* Manual Cache Clearing Tools
* Option to Choose Marquee or Lasso for Selection.
* New Licensing Method

=== GPU Tracking
You can now use the GPU to speed up tracking. 

GPU tracking requires OpenCL 1.2. Graphics cards manufactured since around 2012 will support this but might require an updated driver from the manufacturer.

There are known problems with the NVIDIA graphics driver included in all current versions of Mac OS X. To use an NVIDIA GPU on Mac, please install the updated driver available via the NVIDIA website.

.To turn on GPU tracking:
. Go to mocha preferences
. Go to the GPU page
. Turn on "Track using GPU"
. Choose your appropriate GPU device or leave it as "Automatic"
. Restart mocha

NOTE: GPU tracking currently does not support clips modified by the Lens module or interlaced footage. In these cases, mocha will automatically switch back to CPU tracking.

=== Redesigned Insert Module
We have refined and added to the original Insert module to make it easier to use:

* Now foreground masks can be selected individually or all at once to mask out your insert
* Removed redundant features such as Background alpha clips
* Restructured subtabs to make it easier to focus on which items you need for a particular task.

=== Copy and Pasting Contours
You can now select any layer or contour within a layer and copy it, then paste it to its own layer or to an existing layer.

This works across projects as well.

=== New Import: Silhouette Projects
You can now import Silhouette project files.

=== New Export: Silhouette Shapes
You can now export layers to Silhouette fxs format.

=== New Export: Fusion Shapes
You can now export layers to Fusion shapes. These can be pasted directly into Fusion from mocha via the clipboard.

=== Improved Export for Adobe After Effects Shapes
Shapes for After Effects now paste directly from the playhead, like tracking data does.

This removes the frame padding that existed in the original the shape data so it is easier to control the position in time that you paste to.

=== Vastly Improved Python API

We have added a huge range of new features to the Python API, including:

* Write custom importers and exporters
* Read and write custom image formats
* Tool creation to read mouse events
* OpenGL handling to allow drawing on the canvas

See the Python guide and new reference for more details.

=== Built-in Python Script Editor
To perform quick batch actions or test larger tool ideas, we've added a basic Python script editor.

This allows you to load, run and save scripts.

Note that this is not meant to replace a fully functional IDE.

=== Command Line Render Tools
You can now render and export project file data directly from the command line, making it easier to perform
batch render tasks and get back to work in the mocha GUI.

See the Python guide for more details.

=== Manual Cache Clearing Tools
New cache management tools are now available from the File menu.

You can clear either local project files or the global cache directory.

=== Marquee or Lasso Selection
The selection (Arrow) tool now lets you choose between the usual marquee box or a lasso selection, making it easier to select more complex shapes.

=== New Licensing Method
This edition also introduces a new licensing format to help make activation and deactivation easier for your licenses.

.To license the mocha Pro Standalone:
. Click on 'Activate' in the Welcome Screen or 'Licensing' from the Help menu
. Enter your details into the Registration dialog
. Paste or enter your serial number
. Click 'Next'.
. Click 'Activate'.
. mocha will then exit to reset the license state. Start mocha again to see the licensed product.
