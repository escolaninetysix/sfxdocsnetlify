 Supported Hardware and Drivers
 <a name="bookmark27">
 </a>
 ‌
</p>
<p>
 You need the following hardware and system requirements to use the hardware dependent features in Graffiti 4.0.2. For detailed information on the OpenGL feature in Graffiti 4.0.2. See the Understanding OpenGL pdf on your Graffiti CD or in the Graffiti User Guide.

 Important Note on OpenGL Support
 <a name="bookmark28">
 </a>
 ‌
</p>
<p>
 Due to the fast rate at which OpenGL card manufacturers release drivers, Graffiti may disqualify your OpenGL hardware erroneously. If this happens, you should try to enable OpenGL to see if you benefit from OpenGL acceleration. If you have troubles with slowness, or render inconsistencies, please disable OpenGL. For information on enabling OpenGL, see “Enabling OpenGL” on page 7.
</p>
<p>
 While OpenGL may work in the Graffiti KeyFramer, that does not necessarily mean it will work inside your host application. This is due to the fact that some hosts use OpenGL memory, leaving it unavailable for Graffiti when you work inside the host.
</p>
<p>
 If your host crashes when trying to apply Graffiti, and you cannot disable OpenGL in your host, please contact our technical support staff. They will send you a preferences file that will start Boris Graffiti with OpenGL disabled.
</p>
<p>
 BorisFX will make every effort to continue to qualify OpenGL cards and driver versions. However, it is important to note that it is impossible to qualify all combinations of OpenGL cards, operating system, drivers and host applications. In general you should run the latest driver available for your OpenGL card. If you have problems with the latest driver, visit the Boris website to see a list of the latest supported driver versions.
</p>
<p class="s17">
 <a name="bookmark16">
 </a>
 Supported OpenGL Hardware
 <a name="bookmark29">
 </a>
 ‌
</p>
<p>
 The following graphics cards and drivers are supported for Graffiti’s OpenGL features. This list is current as of the initial Graffiti 4.0.2 release. Boris FX maintains an updated list of tested video cards on our web site: www.Borisfx.com. In general you should download and install the latest driver for your GL card. 
</p>
<p>
 OpenGL is a cross-platform standard that accelerates the rendering of 2D and 3D graphics. Most newer video cards have hardware-based OpenGL acceleration. If your system does not include the recommended minimum requirements, Graffiti initially defaults OpenGL to Off. You can re-enable OpenGL in the Graffiti Preferences window. You can still use Graffiti without OpenGL or with an older card, you just won’t gain as much acceleration while working. For details on how to use OpenGL, see the Graffiti User Guide.
</p>
<p>
 Final Cut Pro 4.x users must have a minimum of Macintosh OS 10.3 installed to support Graffiti’s OpenGL feature.

   Checking your OpenGL Hardware, Software, Drivers and Settings
  </p>
  <p>
   The first time you launch Boris Graffiti, an internal test is run on your system to determine whether your hardware meets the minimum requirements necessary for OpenGL Hardware acceleration. If your hardware does not meet the minimum requirements, OpenGL is disabled by default on your system.
  </p>
  <p>

   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   To perform the OpenGL Hardware test manually, click the
   <b>
    Test OpenGL Hardware button
   </b>
   in the Preferences window’s Render tab.
  </p>
  <p>
   This test may take a few seconds. After the test is run, a window displays specifics of the hardware and drivers on your system. If any test results show your system may have problems running OpenGL, the errors are detailed in this window.
  </p>
  <p>
   The test stresses your OpenGL hardware, so you should run the test with a typical workload. Before you run the OpenGL hardware test, launch any applications that you usually run while you edit (any graphics intensive applications you are running at the time may affect the results).
  </p>
  <p>
   If you want, click the
   <b>
    Copy to Clipboard button
   </b>
   to copy this information to your system clipboard. This allows you to print or email this information. When you finish, click
   <b>
    OK

  </p>
  <p>
   Graffiti uses the following guidelines for optimal OpenGL performance. Some of this information does not affect Graffiti’s hardware testing but is useful for technical support if you are having OpenGL problems:
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   OpenGL version--Should be 1.2 and higher.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Driver Version--As a general rule, you should install and run the latest driver available for your GL card. ATI users should not use driver versions previous to 63.68. NVidia users should not use driver versions previous to 65.00.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Texture Rectangle--This is an advanced OpenGL image sizing feature. If you are having OpenGL problems, this provides useful information for technical support.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Texture Memory-- Texture Memory displays the amount of memory on the video card available for Graffiti to use for textures (layer images).To use Graffiti without display or performance problems, Texture Memory must be at least 32MB. Texture Memory available is not the absolute of memory on your card, but rather the amount available to Graffiti.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Texture Dimension displays the maximum texture size that can be used with the video card.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Macintosh OS Version displays the installed version of the Macintosh OS (if you are running on a Macintosh system.) Macintosh users must have at least Macintosh OS
  </p>
  <p>
   10.2.6 installed to support OpenGL; Final Cut Pro 4.x users, must have at least Macintosh OS 10.3 installed to support OpenGL.
  </p>
  <p class="s4">
   <a name="bookmark18">
   </a>
   OpenGL Errors
  </p>
  <p>
   When the OpenGL Hardware Test is run, error messages may display if your system fails. These errors display as Hardware Status errors or Critical Testing errors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hardware Status errors report the status of your current system setup against Graffiti’s recommended card manufacturer, model and driver. These errors do not prevent you from using OpenGL, they just warn that your specific setup may cause problems with OpenGL.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hardware Status errors can include messages such as insufficient texture memory or reports that your card was not recognized by Graffiti’s internal hardware testing. When you receive a Hardware Status error, OpenGL is automatically disabled when you launch Graffiti.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, you can manually enable OpenGL in the Graffiti Preferences window.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Critical Testing errors
   </b>
   report errors that will
   <u>
    not
   </u>
   allow you to use OpenGL in Graffiti. When you receive a Critical Testing error, OpenGL is automatically disabled when you launch Graffiti. If you receive a Critical Testing error, you should not enable OpenGL or you may crash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Final Cut Pro 4.x users must have at least Macintosh OS version 10.3 installed in order to support Graffiti’s OpenGL feature.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certain errors are influenced by your video card’s display properties, which are card-driver specific. As a general rule, set the display properties to 32 bits of color, with the depth buffer set to at least 16 bits. On many cards OpenGL capabilities are reduced for higher display resolution and refresh rates.

   Enabling OpenGL
   <a name="bookmark30">
   </a>
   ‌
  </p>
  <p>
   You can enable OpenGL in the Preview menu or in the Preferences window.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   To enable OpenGL in the Preference window, choose
   <i>
    <b>
     Edit &gt; Preferences
    </b>
   </i>
   (Windows) or
   <i>
    <b>
     Boris Graffiti &gt; Preferences
    </b>
   </i>
   (Macintosh). Click the Render Tab and select the
   <b>
    Accelerated Draft Preview checkbox
   </b>
   . Choose the appropriate choice from the
   <b>
    OGL Acceleration menu
   </b>
   .
   <i>
    <b>
     On, Max. texture caching
    </b>
   </i>
   provides the best performance and is the recommended setting.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   To enable OpenGL in the Preview menu, choose Preview &gt; Open GL Mode. Choose the appropriate choice from the submenu.
   <i>
    <b>
     On, Max. texture caching
    </b>
   </i>
   provides the best performance and is the recommended setting.
  </p>
  <p class="s4">
   <a name="bookmark20">
   </a>
   Troubleshooting OpenGL Issues
  </p>
  <p>
   To toggle OpenGL off, use the keyboard shortcut Command or Control-[. To turn it back on, the keyboard shortcut Command-] (Macintosh) or Control-] (Windows). Menu choices also appear in the Preview menu and in the Preferences window. You can still use Graffiti without OpenGL or with an older card, you just won’t gain as much acceleration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Display problems such as white, rainbow or garbage images in the Composite window may be related to OpenGL. If this occurs, open the Preference window. In the Render tab, change the
   <b>
    OpenGL Acceleration menu
   </b>
   to use less texture caching. Texture caching is used for textures (layer images) and is related to the amount of Texture memory on the video card. Display problems related to OpenGL will not affect your rendered effects.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you experience OpenGL problems, setting the
   <b>
    OpenGL Acceleration menu
   </b>
   to use less texture caching improves OpenGL reliability, but lessens performance.

   </a>
   Supported Preview to Monitor Hardware
   <a name="bookmark31">
   </a>
   ‌
  </p>
  <p>
   You can output video to an external monitor through a FireWire converter box or through supported video hardware connected to your system. You can output media at any project size and immediately view your working frame without rendering the timeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some hosts have native Preview to Monitor (PTM) where Graffiti passes a frame and the host displays it, for example Meridien-based Avid systems. However, if a host does not have native PTM ability, then you can use the Preview to Monitor feature. The user does not have hardware choices in the Preferences window if Graffiti uses native host PTM (since the host controls the hardware connection).
  </p>
  <p>
   As a plugin, Graffiti does not officially support connecting to hardware that is already in use by the host NLE for direct Video Out purposes. Graffiti can only use the FireWire output if the NLE releases it while Graffiti runs. A number of hosts (for example Premiere and FCP) will not release control of the primary display hardware. This prevents Graffiti's Preview to Monitor feature from working until the NLE releases control of the FireWire hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Graffiti looks for all possible output devices upon installation, and lists the results in the Device menu in the Preview tab of the Boris Graffiti preferences. As a result, users may be able to use a different output device for Graffiti than the one that the host application uses. The host application may use its own capture hardware for display, leaving the FireWire port available.
  </p>
  <p>
   Video-out capabilities are also available in the Boris Graffiti KeyFramer. This enables anyone with supported video hardware, whether built into their computers, included with their NLEs, or provided through third parties, to see the work they create in Boris Graffiti immediately on television monitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Graffiti supports the following video cards for the new Preview to Monitor (PTM) feature in both the Graffiti KeyFramer and while using Graffiti in your host. For detailed information on the new PTM feature, see the User Guide.
  </p>
  <p class="s20">
   Make sure you have the latest drivers installed for the supported video cards.

   Tips for Using the Preview to Monitor Feature
   <a name="bookmark34">
   </a>
   ‌
  </p>
  <p>
   Note for Final Cut Pro version 3.0 Users only: FCP 3 users running Graffiti with FireWire for Graffiti's Preview to Monitor feature, must disconnect before clicking the Apply button or FCP will crash. To disconnect, choose Preview &gt; Disconnect External Monitor.

After leaving Graffiti, reenable the external video (View &gt; External Video &gt; All Frames) to view Final Cut Pro in the external monitor.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Preview to Monitor automatically disconnects when you exit Graffiti. This means each time you launch Graffiti, you need to choose Preview &gt; Connect to External Monitor in order to reconnect and see your image on the external monitor.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   To change the Preview to Monitor device or mode, disconnect by choosing

   </a>
   Applying Boris Graffiti as a Title-Matte Effect
  </p>
  <p>
   You can apply Boris Graffiti directly to titles created in the Avid timeline. For example, if you have a bin with saved titles, you could apply a filter to the titles in Graffiti.
  </p>
  <ol id="l3">
   <ol id="l4">
    <li>
     <p>
      Edit an Avid title or matte key into the Avid timeline.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Open the Avid Effect Palette and select Boris Graffiti from the Effect categories. From the list of available Graffiti effects, drag the
      <i>
       <b>
        Boris Graffiti Title-Matte Effect
       </b>
      </i>
      to the title or matte key in the Avid timeline.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Title-Matte effect is a destructive process which replaces the title or matte key. Removing a Title-Matte effect removes the title’s nested alpha channel. To remove a Title-Matte effect and preserve the alpha, use the Undo command instead of the Remove Effect command.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      Click the
      <b>
       Other Options button
      </b>
      in the Avid Effect Editor to launch Graffiti.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
  </ol>
  <p>
   If the title or matte key looks blocky when Graffiti opens, select its Face track in the timeline. In the Host Media tab, choose
   <i>
    <b>
     Straight Alpha
    </b>
   </i>
   from the
   <b>
    Key menu
   </b>
   . This usually happens automatically.

   Replacing a Title-Matte Effect
  </p>
  <p>
   Since a title is replaced by applying the Title-Matte effect, to re-edit a title with a Title-Matte Effect (for example to change the text or a font) you must save the Title-Matte effect while you are in Graffiti (in the File menu). Recreate the Avid title and overwrite the older title in the Avid timeline. Drag a Graffiti Title-Matte Effect to the new title. In Graffiti, open the saved effect and apply it to the new title.

  <p class="s17">
   <a name="bookmark43">
   </a>
   Launching Boris Graffiti within Edius
  </p>
  <p>
   To launch the Graffiti user interface after applying a Boris effect to a clip, the Edius timeline cursor must be placed over the effect and the track containing the effect must be selected.

   Working with Edius Palettes when Graffiti is Launched
  </p>
  <p>
   When using Boris Graffiti as a Transition effect in Edius, the Edius Palettes remain above the Boris windows. BorisFX has reported this issue to Canopus and is working with them to resolve it in a future release of Edius. Currently, to work around this issue, position the Edius Palettes and Boris windows so they don't overlap.
  </p>
  <p class="s17">
   <a name="bookmark45">

   Editing Previously Rendered Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   In Edius, when a clip is rendered, that clip is locked. Any changes to a Graffiti effect will not display in the Edius Preview window until Edius is closed and reopened. To work around this limitation, complete the following steps:
  </p>
  <ol id="l5">
   <li>
    <p>
     In the Edius settings, click the Render tab.

   Unexplained Crashes in Edius with OpenGL Enabled
  </p>
  <p>
   If Edius crashes when trying to apply Graffiti it may be because OpenGL is enabled. If you cannot disable OpenGL, launch the standalone Graffiti KeyFramer to disable OpenGL, then you should be able to apply Graffiti within Edius as a plug-in. You can also contact our technical support staff. They will send you a preferences file that starts Graffiti with OpenGL disabled.

   Applying Multiple Boris Graffiti Filters to a Clip in Edius
  </p>
  <p>
   You should be aware of some issues when applying multiple Graffiti filters to a clip.
  </p>
  <p class="s4">
   <a name="bookmark48">
   </a>
   Stacking Multiple Overlapping Boris Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   We do not recommend adding multiple Graffiti effects to an Edius clip or stacking clips containing Graffiti effects on multiple layers in the Edius timeline. Depending on your system specifics, multiple Boris effects (&gt;2) on a clip may not render properly. Instead, apply a single Graffiti effect to an Edius clip and add multiple effects to the clip within Graffiti.
  </p>
  <p>
   This limitation only applies to effects that overlap exactly. For example, a track containing both an in and an out transition would not fall under this suggestion (since they can not overlap).
  </p>
  <p class="s4">
   <a name="bookmark49">
   </a>
   Applying More than one Boris Effect to a Clip
  </p>
  <p>
   If there is more than one Boris effect applied to a clip, the effect of preceding filters will not display in the subsequent filters in the Graffiti user interface. For example, if first a blur filter and then a twirl filter are applied to the same Edius clip, the blur filter effect will not show in the effected track when the ripple effect is launched. However, all effects display during render in the Edius Preview window.
  </p>

   Playing Boris Graffiti Effects
  </p>
  <p>
   Edius timeline playback stops when trying to play through a Boris effect. To fix this, in the Edius settings deselect the
   <i>

   Working in Boris Graffiti when Edius is Running
  </p>
  <p>
   When Graffiti is launched, Edius is unable to perform other actions (such as closing). It is possible to get Edius into a state where it thinks Graffiti is launched, but the Graffiti user interface does not appear. This will functionally lock Edius. To resolve this, delete the Graffiti .ini file in the root:\\WINDOWS folder, and launch Graffiti again. If this doesn't work, save the Edius project, force a manual close of Edius (Control- Alt-Delete), delete the Graffiti .ini file, then launch Edius again.

   ‌
  </p>
  <p>
   Final Cut Pro 4.x users must have at least Macintosh OS version 10.3 installed in order to support Graffiti’s OpenGL feature.
  </p>
  <p>
   To use Graffiti’s Preview to Monitor feature, you must turn off the external video in Final Cut Pro before launching Graffiti. Choose View &gt; External Video &gt; Off before launching Graffiti, then enable Graffiti’s Preview to Monitor feature when Graffiti is launched. After leaving Graffiti, reenable the external video (View &gt; External Video &gt; All Frames) to see Final Cut Pro video in the external monitor.
  </p>
  <ul id="l6">
   <li>
    <p>
     Final Cut Pro 3 users running Graffiti as a plug-in with FireWire for Graffiti's Preview to Monitor feature, must disconnect before clicking the Apply button or FCP will crash. To disconnect, choose Preview &gt; Disconnect External Monitor.

     Graffiti includes a

     for
     <i>
      <b>
       Final Cut Pro
      </b>
     </i>
     . The Static Generator allows you to create a static slate which takes advantage of Final Cut Pro’s real-time capabilities. When you apply the Static Generator, the Boris timeline opens with a duration of one frame which can then be applied to Final Cut Pro as a static slate.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Graffiti now correctly field renders video in the wells when using a Graffiti FCP Generator. However, media placed in the input wells for a Graffiti Generator should match the FCP sequence size. Both the Graffiti project size and the size of the well video appear in Graffiti at the FCP sequence size. If the well media is not the same as the FCP sequence size, fields won't render correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Additionally, any video in the input wells should be the same size as the clip with Graffiti applied. In the case of Graffiti applied as a filter, the Graffiti project size is determined by the size of the filtered media. Once again the size of the filtered media needs to match any video in the wells. This will maintain the integrity of fields since Graffiti doesn't allow host video inputs of various sizes within the same effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     To use media whose size doesn’t match the FCP sequence size (Generator) or the Filter media size, the best approach is to import that media directly into the Boris timeline from disk (rather than from the wells in FCP). This will provide you with full flexibility for dealing with non-standard size images, field interpretation, and oversize images.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     To edit an existing Graffiti effect, make sure the playhead is positioned on the effect you want to edit before launching Graffiti. Otherwise, the Boris interface will not appear.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     To export from Graffiti, set the FCP resolution to 100%. Otherwise, you get reduced image quality, since FCP does not provide full-size frames. Likewise, if Final Cut Pro is at less than full resolution (100%), previews at full size appear in reduced quality.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     In some instances the Graffiti plug-in crashes due to an apparent conflict with MacsBug v6.6.3. If you have MacsBug 6.6.3 installed and experience crashing, try disabling or running an earlier version of MacsBug when using Graffiti.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     If more than one version of Graffiti is installed, the Effects menu lists both versions with the same name: Boris Graffiti. The top item in the list is Graffiti 4.0.2 and the second item is the earlier version. We recommend uninstalling earlier versions.

     sets lower field dominance,
     <i>

     Important Information about Exporting to Flash
     <a name="bookmark70">
     </a>
     ‌
    </p>
    <p>
     Boris Graffiti allows you to export files in the Macromedia Flash (SWF) format. This allows you to export compositions as compact, vector-based files optimized for web viewing. For example, you could export a Type On effect to include on a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
     Graffiti exports Flash .swf files that are compliant with the Flash 5 architecture. If you are using QuickTime to preview your exported .swf files, you need a version of QuickTime that supports the Flash 5 format. The following effects are supported for exporting to Flash.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Text
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Spline media
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     2D Charts (which consist of text and spline shapes)
    </p>
    <p>
     Other bitmap elements such as video or still graphics can be included in the exported Flash file and will be JPEG-compressed. In the Export preferences you can set the quality of the JPEG compression.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you export text to Flash, any texture that was applied to the text is ignored.  When you export text with a gradient fill to Flash, the resulting .swf file is blank.
    </p>
    <p class="s17">
     <a name="bookmark69">
     </a>
     Exporting as Flash
    </p>
    <p>
     The SWF format was designed primarily for animated 3D Line Art objects, so it works well when exporting settings that contain spline and text animations. Settings that contain video or animated bitmaps, however, generate rather large files. You might want to consider exporting such animations as a QuickTime or AVI file. See “Exporting Effects as Movies” on page 297 in the Graffiti User Guide for details.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Flash export feature has some limitations. You cannot export 3D Extrusion tracks as Flash. Settings that contain 3D Extrusion tracks export as a blank track. The Flash export feature does not support shadows or gradients used as Texture tracks. However, you can export a static gradient as a bitmap background.
    </p>
    <p>
     To prepare to export to Flash, you should change any shape track containing text or Spline media to the 3D Line Art shape. Because you cannot use the 3D Line Art shape with the Brush tool, you cannot export brush strokes as Flash.

     Important Information Using the KeyFrame Library
     <a name="bookmark72">
     </a>
     ‌
    </p>
    <p>
     The first time you browse the KeyFrame Library effects within the Library Browser you must generate thumbnail images for the effects.
    </p>
    <ol id="l8">
     <li>
      <p>
       Open the Boris Library Browser, by choosing Window &gt; Library Browser,
       <img src="https://bfxcdn.s3.amazonaws.com/borisfx/wpborisfxuploads/2015/09/Image_047.jpg" alt="image" width="27" height="19">
       clicking the
       <b>
        Open Library Browser button
       </b>
       in the timeline or pressing
      </p>
      <p>
       Command-9 (Macintosh) or Control-9 (Windows).
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Select an effect or effect folder and click the
       <b>
        Generate Thumbnails button
       </b>
       . For more information on using the KeyFrame Library, see the Graffiti User Guide.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     We recommend that you build thumbnail previews for the KeyFrame Library in the Graffiti KeyFramer rather than within your host application. Because building previews actually renders your effect, this process can take as much as 25-30% longer in the plug-in than in the Graffiti KeyFramer.

     Fixed Bugs in Boris Graffiti since Version 4.0
     <a name="bookmark74">
     </a>
     ‌
    </p>
    <p>
     Graffiti 4.0.2 includes many bug fixes from the initial version 4.0 of Graffiti. Fixed bugs include the following. Some of the following bugs were fixed in earlier versions of Graffiti.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Graffiti now correctly supports Macintosh OS X 10.4.2 (Tiger).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Graffiti 4.0.2 settings now correctly open in Red 3.0.4.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p class="s16">
     Avid only: Graffiti now correctly installs into Avid Xpress Pro 4.8 and Adrenaline 1.8 systems.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     An issue with QuickTime export movies has been fixed, which previously caused a crash in certain hosts plug-ins (primarily on Windows AVX hosts). This crash could also occur when selecting the QT codec.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     German umlaut fonts now correctly display in Graffiti.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Third-party Asian fonts now appear correctly when typing in the Text window.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p class="s16">
     Final Cut Pro users only: Graffiti version 4.02 now correctly field renders synthetic media (titles and splines) when you apply as a generator. However, this fix will not work for legacy projects from FCP version 3.0. A previously version corrected a related problem so that other media types would field render video in the wells when using an FCP Generator. However, the media placed in the input wells for a Generator should match the FCP sequence size. Both the Graffiti size and the size of the well video will appear in Graffiti at the FCP sequence size. If the well media is not the same as the FCP sequence size, fields won't render correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Additionally, any video in the input wells should be the same size as the filtered clip. When applied as a filter, the Graffiti project size is determined by the size of the filtered media which needs to match any video in the wells. This will maintain the integrity of fields since Graffiti doesn't allow host video inputs of various sizes within the same effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a case that requires media sources whose size will not match the FCP sequence size (Generator) or the filter media size, the best approach is to import that media into the Graffiti timeline from disk (rather than from the wells in FCP). This provides flexibility for dealing with non-standard size images, field interpretation, and oversize images.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In Graffiti 3.0 the Preview To Monitor for Avid feature was disabled even when running in Meridien-based Avid versions. This was corrected in Graffiti 3.0.1.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p class="s16">

  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p class="s16">
   Final Cut Pro 4.0 only: In earlier versions, Graffiti could crash when applied as a filter or static generator in a setup that included a custom screen layout, such as color correction. This problem would occur when relaunching the Graffiti user interface. This problem has been corrected.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The 1-2-1 Deflicker preference is now correctly saved with your Preferences file.

     If you tumble an object that has an image bump map, you may see a moire pattern as it tumbles.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you save a style to the Materials tab in the Style Palette, it does not correctly save the Source type that was used in the Bump Map tab.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you open settings created in previous versions of Graffiti, Graffiti 4.0.2 ignores controls that were initially enabled in the Lights 2 and 3 tabs.

    <p>
     When you search for a missing media file using the
     <b>

     Tracks containing PSD files that are converted to containers do not correctly update if you modify them (for example in Photoshop) and then use the Reload Files command.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you choose
     <i>
      <b>
       Targa Sequence
      </b>
     </i>
     as a file type when exporting a movie file, clicking the
     <b>
      Compression Settings button
     </b>
     erroneously displays QuickTime codec selections.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Files exported to Flash from Graffiti cannot be used in Macromedia Flash authoring applications such as Flash MX.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     If you use the Keyframe Time field in the timeline to move keyframes, all keyframes that a moving keyframe passes are merged to it. Instead, move keyframes past one another by dragging the mouse.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Photoshop (.psd) files with adjustment layers display incorrectly in Graffiti if you convert their track to a container. Turn off any adjustment layers in Photoshop before importing .psd files if you plan on converting them to containers.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Microsoft DV Type 1 filters do not work in Graffiti as audio tracks.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     You cannot adjust Volume and Balance for Graffiti audio files do not update after you have changed them once.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Previewing with audio while you Preview to RAM to Monitor will disconnect Preview to an external monitor.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Audio waveforms do not update when you adjust the global timeline. This is only a display issue and can be corrected by moving something slightly in the Composite window.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Resuming a partial render of an exported QuickTime file may have some undesirable results. In particular, video compressed with codecs that use frame-differencing and data-rate-limiting (such as Sorenson or Cinepak) may exhibit the following behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some frames following the resume point may be corrupted. The data rate may be slightly larger than expected. Also, if the file includes an audio track, a slight blip may be heard at the resume point. This may occur with any codec.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you apply a title container to the timeline and add text into the container, you cannot successfully change the Background Color (in the Render tab). However, if you disable OpenGL, you can change the color if you view in High Quality.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you use Frame-Differenced movies (including movies compressed with Apple’s QuickTime Animation codec and some movies compressed with Sorenson), you will see reduced performance. The use of Frame-Differenced movies is not recommended within Graffiti.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When host field media is exported or previewed as frames, only the first field is used.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When an image is full size in the Composite window, you must deselect the Shape control in the Composite window’s Controls menu to directly manipulate an object’s Mask or Crop controls.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Windows only: Balance and Volume controls have no affect on audio tracks containing AVI files or MP3 files.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Windows only: Boris Graffiti exports Flash.swf files that are compliant with the Flash 5 architecture. If you are using QuickTime to preview your exported.swf files, your QuickTime version must support the Flash 5 format. Older versions of QuickTime display the background as a solid color.

   Limitations with Edius Systems Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In Edius, when a clip is rendered, that clip is locked. Any changes to a Graffiti effect will not display in the Edius Preview window until Edius is closed and reopened. To work around this limitation, complete the following steps:
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Edius settings, click the Render tab. In the
   <b>
    Delete invalid rendering files
   </b>
   section, choose
   <i>
    <b>
     When the Rendered File is Invalid
    </b>
   </i>
   . Unrender the clip by making a change, such as toggling the checkbox to disable/reenable the effect in the Edius Information Palette.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   At this time Boris products do not support being launched from inside other Edius filters (for example, the Combine or Region Edius filters).

   Limitations with Pinnacle Systems Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Pinnacle Liquid Only: When you apply Boris as a transition and launch Graffiti, Graffiti’s Composite window incorrectly displays the outgoing clip as the incoming clip. This is only a cosmetic problem and the transition will render correctly in Liquid. To work around this limitation, do one of the following.
  </p>
  <p>
   Create the transition in Graffiti as if your clips are correct. When you finish, apply the effect to Liquid and render your transition. The final render will be correct.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alternatively you can press the
   <b>
    Media icon
   </b>
   in each Graffiti track and swap Video 1 and Video 2. When you create your transition it will look correct in Graffiti. Remember to swap them back before applying to Liquid.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When Graffiti is applied to a segment that also has a transition (including a native Liquid Transition) applied, the effect previews correctly, but renders as if the effect was applied twice (once on the video segment and again during the duration of the transition).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Although choices appear for accessing video tracks 1 - 32, you can only successfully access tracks 1 and 2. Tracks higher than two display as black. This is a limitation of the Pinnacle plug-in architecture.

   Limitations with Sony Vegas Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When you create an effect in Graffiti that will output an alpha channel to Vegas (for example a title which does not include the background video), when you apply the effect back to the vegas timeline you will notice the edges appear rough and contain white fringes. You need to reenter Graffiti on the effect and in the Graffiti Preferences set the Local Preferences’
   <b>
    Alpha Type menu
   </b>
   to
   <i>
    <b>
     Premultiplied with Black
    </b>
   </i>
   . The effect will display correctly when you apply back to Vegas. You will need to do this every time you create an effect that outputs alpha.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If a Boris effect is prerendered in the Vegas timeline, future changes to that effect in Boris will be saved but do not appear in the Vegas Preview window until you remove the prerender in Vegas (Tools &gt; Clean up Prerendered Video).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Vegas only previews a single frame of host video in Boris Graffiti. The preview frame is taken from the current position of the Vegas cursor. To preview your effect with updating source media, exit Graffiti and preview the effect in the Vegas Video timeline or import the video directly into the Graffiti timeline.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Motion Blur does not display in a rendered effect if you apply Graffiti directly to a clip in Vegas. Instead, import the media directly into the Graffiti timeline and you will see motion blur after you render your effect.

   Limitations with Ulead Only
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When using Graffiti as a transition in Ulead, the image quality for host media in the Composite window is very poor. This is because Ulead does not pass a full size image. However, this does not affect rendering. The effect renders in high quality.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When using Graffiti within Ulead with the Matrox Parhelia board, you may run into crashing problems. We do not recommend using the Matrox Parhelia board with Graffiti.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Projects in certain versions of ULead Media Studio Pro may display jagged edges or reversed fields in rendered Boris effects. If your system shows this problem, you can install a registry key that indicates that ULead’s video fields should be reversed. This is found on the top level of the Boris CD in the Ulead Field Change folder.

   Limitations with the Spline Object Media Type
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you select a group of splines in the Composite window and adjust one of the Path track’s control parameters, the changes are not applied to any of the splines. The Path controls can only adjust one spline at a time.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The
   <i>
    <b>

   Limitations with Text Features
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>

  <p>
   Tracking behaves differently depending on whether the text was created with the Text tool or in the Text window. When you create text with the Text tool, the tracking honors the justification that is set in the Transform tab. When you create text in the Text window, the tracking is applied with center justification. If you want to track to the right or left using text that was created in the Text window, select the text with the Text tool and move it slightly. Then set the justification in the Transform tab. The Tracking now uses the justification. For details, see “Working with the Transform Tab” in the User Guide.

  <p>
   Importing RTF documents using the
   <i>
    <b>
     Insert Text

 <li>
  <p>
   Text on a Path moving from right to left will display upside down. To correct this, manually reverse the path, or click the

   Limitations with Chart Features
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Accented letters such as é are not passed from the Chart Editor to the Chart Container correctly. Therefore, a Chart Legend or Grid label that uses accented characters must be entered directly into the text track, using the Text tool or Text window. If this is necessary, it must be done as a final step when building the chart. This is because editing the chart data or enabling/disabling the Legend or Grid updates this text using Chart Editor text; as a result, the accented characters will be lost.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When both the
   <b>
    Reveal
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    Remove checkboxes
   </b>
   are enabled in the Animation tab, Position X no longer animates when you work with extruded Bar and Pie Charts.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Removing an extruded Bar Chart by selecting the
   <b>
    Reveal Shape checkbox
   </b>
   in the Animation tab does not work correctly. Instead of animating the height of the bars sequentially, they are simply removed individually. In addition, when this checkbox is selected, the Overlap Time parameter is not respected.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   For the most reliable results, the
   <b>
    Animate button
   </b>
   should not be in static mode when working with charts. For more information, see the Graffiti User Guide.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   On certain systems, extruded pie charts pieces may incorrectly display their corners. Reduce the Bevel to 0 to fix this.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you have long names for the X axis (defaults: South, East, West, and North), and you are animating the chart (if you have animation turned on) the names will not line up with the actual chart.
  </p>
  <ul id="l10">
   <li>
    <p>
     Selecting the
     <b>
      Apply Current Spline Style checkbox
     </b>
     can create unintended changes if the setting is modified after another spline style is selected. For example, you create a static Line chart with the
     <b>
      Apply Current Spline Style checkbox
     </b>
     selected. You apply another spline style from the Style Palette to a different track. If you then animate the chart, the chart will update with the latest spline style, rather than the style originally saved with the effect. The only workaround necessary is to reapply the original spline style from the Style Palette.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Depending on the scale you set for a Line Chart, you may see small nicks or indentations in the lines when you work in Full Resolution. Slightly increase or decrease the scale of the line chart to fix this.

     Limitations with Filters
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Any effect that uses a filter involving edge detection (for example, RGB Edges) should be rendered with the
     <b>
      Better Quality Field Rendering checkbox
     </b>
     selected. Otherwise, the rendered effect will jitter.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     In the 2D Particles filters, increasing the particle size scale can cause some custom shapes to truncate. You can avoid this by looking at the initial, unscattered particle grid. If some particles are cut off by the frame when you increase their size, then they will remain cut off throughout the duration of the effect. To avoid this, adjust the size parameters so that no particles are initially cut off.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The first rendered frame of effects using the 2D Particles Advanced filter will display particles, although you will not see particles in the first frame of a preview.
