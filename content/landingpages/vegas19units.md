* Most products in the Boris FX Suite are plugins and require a host application. The Boris FX Suite is a multi-host product that supports Adobe, Avid, and select OFX hosts. Always be aware which host and operating system you need for download. See the FAQ for more info. 

##### Already own Boris FX products?
Your Boris FX Suite license will only support the most recent version of Boris FX products. If you own any older Boris FX products, please be aware that installing newer versions may not work with your older license.  
We highly recommend deactivating and then uninstalling the older Boris FX products before installing to avoid problems.

To remove older Continuum or Sapphire plugins, right-click the Start button and click Control Panel. Go to Programs and Features (if your Control Panel is in Category view, go to Uninstall a Program). Find the Boris FX product, click to select it, and then click Uninstall. See the FAQ

#### Wacom/Boris FX FAQ

**Q. I purchased a Wacom product and received a free product from Boris FX. Is this true?**
Yes! For a limited time, customers who purchase a Wacom Intuos Pro or Cintiq product can redeem a free 3-month subscription to the Boris FX Suite. The Boris FX Suite contains 5 products: Sapphire, Continuum. Mocha Pro, Silhouette and Optics.

**Q. How do I get my free Boris FX software?**
Customers must first create an account and register their Wacom products with [Wacom](https://www.wacom.com/). After registering, you can find Partner Offers in your Wacom account. If you have an active offer from Boris FX, you can click it to find your activation code and registration link.     

**Q. Ok, I have filled out the Boris FX registration form above, now what?**
After entering your key, you will receive an email with installation instructions and a download link for each specific product found in the Boris FX Suite. 

**Q. Wait a second, there are 5 products and 1 activation key. Do I need to download each product separately?**
Yes, each plugin product has a unique installer depending on the host application or operating system. You do need to install each product by host separately, but the license only needs to be activated once. 

**Q. How do I activate? All my plugins have a watermark on them. How do I fix this?**
The products either have a “License” button in the plugin interface or launch the application to and find a license dialogue in the help menu. Your license only needs to be activated once for all products in the Boris FX Suite to work. To find specific licenses instructions for each product, [visit our license section.](https://borisfx.com/support/license-instructions/) 

**Q. How can I learn? Do you have online training?** 
Yes, we have hundreds of free [online training videos](https://borisfx.com/videos/) and [documentation/user guides.](https://borisfx.com/support/documentation/)
Online training videos are searchable and can be filtered to browse videos by product, host or category. 

**Q. What do these products do anyways?**
The Boris FX Suite consists of 5 products for video post-production and photo editing. You can visit each product page to learn more: [Sapphire](https://borisfx.com/products/sapphire/?collection=sapphire&product=sapphire), [Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/?collection=continuum&product=continuum), [Mocha Pro](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/?collection=mocha-pro&product=mocha-pro), [Silhouette](https://borisfx.com/products/silhouette/?collection=silhouette&product=silhouette), and [Optics](https://borisfx.com/products/optics/?collection=optics&product=optics)

**Q. I am confused. Which of your products is a plugin and which is a standalone application? Do I need a host to run the Boris FX Suite?** 
Sorry for the confusion. You can find a [Host Compatibility Chart here](https://borisfx.com/host-compatibility/?&platform=All%20Operating%20Systems&product=All%20Products&host=All%20Hosts) or use this cheat sheet. Sapphire and Continuum are plugin-only, while the other products have both plugin and standalone application options:  

**Continuum** and **Sapphire** are **plugin collections** and do require a host application. Popular supported hosts include Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic Resolve and Fusion, Foundry Nuke (Sapphire only), Autodesk Flame (Sapphire only), and VEGAS Pro.  

**Mocha Pro** is a **plugin** and **standalone application**. Popular Mocha hosts include Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic Fusion, Foundry Nuke, Autodesk Flame, and VEGAS Pro. Mocha Pro standalone can be installed on macOS, Windows, and Linux.  

**Silhouette** is primarily a **standalone application**, but also has a Paint plugin that is included in the installation. The plugin supports Adobe, Blackmagic, Nuke, Flame, and VEGAS Pro. Silhouette standalone can be installed on macOS, Windows, and Linux.  

**Optics** is a **plugin** for Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Optics also has a standalone application (included in the Optics installer) that supports macOS and Windows. 

If you do not own any of our supported host applications, but want to use our products, you can install Mocha Pro, Silhouette, Optics, and we also have a free particle animation standalone called [Particle Illusion](https://borisfx.com/products/particle-illusion/?collection=continuum-premium-filters&product=continuum-filter-particle-illusion). 

**Q. I had some older Boris plugins that disappeared. What happened?**
Only one version of Boris FX plugins can be installed for any given host at any one time. So, if you have Adobe Premiere Pro with legacy Boris FX plugins installed, these will be replaced with the newer versions found in the Boris FX Suite. We strongly suggest — if you wish to keep the older Boris FX plugins — that you deactivate your older products and remove/de-install from your system. You are free to avoid the duplicated products and only install and activate the Boris FX products that you choose. 

**Q. I love the Boris FX products, however I do not need the entire Boris FX Suite. What are my options to purchase just one of these products?** 
Sure, every product found in the Boris FX Suite is available individually for purchase or subscription. Please [visit our webshop](https://borisfx.com/store) or [contact our sales team](https://borisfx.com/store/contact-us/).  

**Q. What happens when my 3 month subscription expires?**
Your Boris FX Suite license will expire 3-months after you activate. The software will only work in a watermarked mode once your subscription ends. Customers who wish to extend their license can purchase a subscription or a new perpetual license from our [webshop](https://borisfx.com/store/?collection=boris-fx-suite&product=boris-fx-suite). Boris FX offers many options including annual and monthly subscriptions as well as [Educational](https://borisfx.com/store/academic-pricing/) and [Enterprise](https://borisfx.com/store/enterprise/) licenses.  

**Q. I am having issues painting with my Wacom tablet in Silhouette. (or Silhouette Paint). Why does the Clone brush cursor lag when using a Wacom tablet in Silhouette?**
There is a known issue with Silhouette v2020.5 and specific Wacom models. We have a fix for this coming in Silhouette 2021 (shipping late March 2021).
