Stage Light can read an unlimited number of AE native point and spotlights in the composition, includes a built-in mechanism lets users selectively determine which lights to use in the scene via a simple naming convention, and can also use AE’s native 3D cameras. If you’re working in multiple AE views, the visible light is correctly rendered in each view regardless of whether the lights are viewing the render camera or a non-production orthogonal view.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/images/web/StageLight_Image1_B.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">View the before / after images</a>.",
