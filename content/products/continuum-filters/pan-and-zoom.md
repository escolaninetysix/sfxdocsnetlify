    "content": "Create Ken Burns stylized 3D animations from any sill image source with the Continuum Pan and Zoom filter. The fully automated keyframeless workflow makes short work of generating smooth animations and the integrated watch folder option means that you can work with low resolution images for quick set up and insert a high resolution replacement image when you’re ready to roll, while retaining all of the animation setup work. And the inclusion of the Magic Sharp image processing algorithm means that image quality is second to none, even when upscaling source shots."
