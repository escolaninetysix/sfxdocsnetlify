In side-by-side mode the screen is split with the original source displayed on the left and the filtered result on the right. The image can be repositioned in the split panel giving you complete access to view any region of the source and the filtered result in the viewer.\n\nGet the full effect! <a href=\"https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/images/web/BroadcastSafe_2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">View a full-sized version of the image</a>."

For instance, in scenes where a client logo is in the picture, it is helpful to know whether the colors being used are being subject to a change from the legalizer. Broadcast Safe includes both a clipped pixels and a zebra pattern option to highlight parts of the image that are being altered. In this image you can see that regions in the source that were deemed by the selected preset to be outside of legal range are identified to the user with an overlaid zebra pattern.\n\nGet the full effect! <a href=\"https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/images/web/BroadcastSafe_7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">View a full-sized version of the image</a>."
