At the core of the filter we have the academy award winning mocha masking and tracking system, which can be used to isolate any number of objects in a scene for treatment with the integrated effects. And speaking of effects, the Witness Protection filter includes 4 user selectable options (blur, mosaic, tint, brightness/contrast) each of which can be fully customized to suit the specific source shot that you’re working with."
