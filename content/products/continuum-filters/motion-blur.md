    "content": "The Continuum Motion Blur filter creates a realistic blur on areas in the source clip that are in motion, simulating the effect of shooting a moving object on film. For example, apply the Motion Blur filter to a clip of a speeding car and the car’s motion would blur while the background would not. The blur is most pronounced when the object moves quickly and more subtle when it moves slowly. Motion blur is not visible if the image is static.<br><br>Based upon optical flow technology, this filter examines past and future frames to determine the motion of the pixels in the image. Depending upon the selected settings, a blur or a smear is applied to the pixels that move from one frame to the next. You can also use a clip in the timeline as a source for motion and then apply the motion from the chosen clip to the filtered track."

Blur will use motion data from past and future frames to create a bi-directional blurred result, where the blur will appear on both sides of the moving object. Smear ignores future frames and only uses data from motion detected in past frames, the result being that the blur is applied only on one side of the moving object. \n\nIn the image, both sides of the birds wings are blurred when the Blur option is selected. Only the trailing edge of the wing is blurred when the Smear option is selected.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/images/web/MB_Image3_lg.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">View a larger image</a>.",

This Advanced mode uses OpenCL hardware assisted rendering to implement a more sophisticated (and more computationally intensive) motion vector analysis.  The performance of the Advanced mode varies widely from one graphics card to another and if you see reduced performance or unexpected results when using the Advanced option it is recommended that you switch to the Simple mode on that card.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/images/web/MB_Image4_lg.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">View a larger image</a>.",
