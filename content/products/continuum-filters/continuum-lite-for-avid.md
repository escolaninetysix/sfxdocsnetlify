The powerful feature, found in most Continuum effects, lets you quickly create a moving matte by choosing pixels based on their geometric position, color or luma. The PixelChooser has been newly redesigned for the most recent Continuum release (v11) and is now easier to use and more feature rich than ever before.\n\nThe newly integrated (and Academy Award-winning) Mocha planar tracking and masking system lets you create even more advanced VFX right alongside the PixelChooser. Quickly track your mattes across multiple frames — a serious timesaver for busy editors on tight deadlines. You now have access to the same Mocha tracking and masking toolset used by the world’s top VFX artists on practically every feature film. \n"
