    "content": "The Continuum Magic Sharp filter is a state-of-the-art image enhancement tool. Magic Sharp goes above and beyond any other image sharpening filter available today. <br><br>Unsharp masking is the traditional method of enhancing image detail in a source clip. It is an age old photographic technique, which uses blurred masks and compositing tricks to bring out detail contrast in the image source. Unsharp masking works at a basic level. When you use Magic Sharp, you will increase sharpness and enhance detail contrast in your image without introducing unwanted artifacts (say goodbye the contour haloing!). All this in a hardware accelerated filter that will run on any video card across all supported platforms and hosts.<br><br>Magic Sharp generates razor sharp results without generating any unwanted image contouring.",
