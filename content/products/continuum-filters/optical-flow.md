    "content": "Traditional methods of clip retiming are typically based on frame blending, which can generate a blurry result which is easily detectable by the human eye, especially when using keyframes to adjust the clip speed over time. The Continuum Optical Flow filter engine uses Optical Flow technology to determine which pixels in the frame are moving and then uses this result to synthesize new pixel data resulting in a clean and sharp retimed result.
