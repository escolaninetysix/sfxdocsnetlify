      "content": "<b>Do I need to have internet access to use the Application Manager?</b><br>For the best experience, yes, your workstation should be connected to the Internet so the Application Manager can connect to the Boris FX servers and verify licensing.<br><br><b>I have an older version of a Boris FX product, will it work with Application Manager?</b><br>We strongly encourage everyone to upgrade to the latest 2020 versions of all products if you want to use the Application Manager. While some older versions of Boris FX plugins may work with the Application Manager, we cannot guarantee they will work, and only fully support the 2020 product lineup.<br><br><b>Will the Application Manager work with a floating license?</b><br>The Application Manager will display the total number of activations for an installed floating license. Boris FX floating licenses cannot be activated or released via the Application Manager.<br><br><b>Can I move a Sapphire license between workstations without the whole uninstall/reinstall process with the Boris FX Applicaton Manager?</b><br>Yes! Solving this problem was one of the main reasons the App Manager was created, and we are happy to offer this new functionality to Sapphire customers and an easier, simpler, and more intuitive workflow for Mocha and Continuum customers.<br><br><b>Why am I seeing all those Boris FX products that I don’t use? Can I just show what I have installed?</b><br>Yes, under the “Preferences” tab, check “Show Installed Apps Only”.<br><br><b>License Control</b><br>The App Manager cannot be used to enter a new license, it can only be used to deactivate and reactivate an existing license. License keys should be entered during software installation or via the BFX License Tool"
