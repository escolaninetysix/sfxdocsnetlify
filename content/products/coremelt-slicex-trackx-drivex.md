SliceX includes eleven motion templates for common tasks and you can also use the Shape Masks with built in effects, the built in color corrector or with third party plugins. SliceX powered by mocha takes the pain out of following complex motion, just draw a shape and hit track. You can then adjust with manual keyframes as needed.\n",
