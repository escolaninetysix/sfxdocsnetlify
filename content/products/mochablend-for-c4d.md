    "content": "*“MochaBlend C4D is a ground breaking tool…”* – David Torno, Technical Director, Ghost Town Media\n\nMochaBlend C4D is the exciting new plug-in for Maxon Cinema 4D that converts Mocha’s 2D planar tracking into 3D motion. This new tool delivers innovative new ways for 3D artists to work with tracking & roto data.\n\nSingle Plane Solver: Solve camera & objects, perspective tracks & non-perspective tracks.\n\nMochaBlend C4D converts roto-splines from Mocha into animated geometry with depth that can interact with both physics and simulations inside 3D animation programs.\n\nMochaBlend C4D imports mocha’s camera-solve data, more easily, and with more options.\n\nAE Exporter: Includes MochaBlend Exporter for Adobe After Effects. Export animated masks from AE to C4D!\n\n![alt text](//cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/Website%202017/mochablend_blog2.png \"MochaBlend C4D\")\n\n*“Potentially game-changing, the plug-in offers a way to create objects which would otherwise take weeks.”* – 3D World Magazine\n\nNotes: MochaBlend supports C4D versions R14 and above. MochaBlend supports Adobe bundled Mocha AE for 2D track import, but requires mocha Pro for mocha’s mask support and 3D Camera Solve support. \n\nMochaBlend C4D is developed by [Good Spirit Graphics](https://goodspiritgraphics.com/). Visit to learn about [MochaBlend for Blender](https://goodspiritgraphics.com/software/products/mochablend/mochablend-c4d/intro/) and other products.\n\n*“MochaBlend C4D bridges the gap between Mocha’s powerful planar tracking and C4D’s creative 3D tools. It is a workflow that many artists have been looking for.”*  - Ross Shain, Imagineer Systems\n\n*“I see artists expanding their creative visions with these easy to use tools.  Now they can do things in minutes that were either impossible before MochaBlend C4D, or were so difficult to do that they just didn’t bother.”* – Chris Barrett, Good Spirit Graphics\n\n[Download the user guide.](//cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/Website%202017/mochablend_help.pdf)\n"
