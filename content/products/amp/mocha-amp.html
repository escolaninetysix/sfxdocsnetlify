"content0": "Mega Plate module: Use planar tracking and temporal frame analysis to create extended stitched frames for advanced effects and clean up tasks. Area Brush: Dynamic new paint tool with Quick Mask mode to quickly create tracking and masking layers. OpenColorIO: color management for high-end VFX and finishing workflows. Python scripting: now updated to support Python 3.7.",

"content": "Mega Plate is a unique new module building on Mocha Pro’s most powerful core technologies — planar tracking and temporal frame analysis — to create a stitched extended frame for visual effects tasks.",
"image_url1": "",
"content1": "Area Brush is a new paint tool that speeds up Mocha’s most common core task — creating shapes. Area Brush with Quick Mask mode brings fluid gestural paint functionality into Mocha to define planar tracking and masking search areas. Instead of clicking and dragging spline points, add and subtract paint strokes are converted to vector splines — greatly speeding up and simplifying multi-shape tracking and masking set-ups. The Area Brush also supports Wacom tablets for pressure-sensitive scaling.",
"image_url2": "",
"content2": "Mocha Pro 2020 adds industry-standard OpenColorIO color management for consistent and predictable color display across industry workflows. OCIO support is compatible with the Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and enables improved color-managed workflows with high-end post-production and VFX applications such as Silhouette, Foundry’s NUKE, Autodesk Flame, Avid Media Composer, and more."

"content": "Planar tracking is at the heart of all Mocha Pro modules and is used to drive tracking, masking, object removal, stabilization, and more. Unlimited tracking layers and the advanced AdjustTrack module helps handle reflections, occlusions, noise, and even areas with motion blur or low details.",

"content2": "Mocha Pro’s integrated plug-in option delivers a fast & efficient workflow using the host’s media engine. Launch Mocha Pro from within your favorite editing and effects hosts.",
"image_url3": "",
"content3": "Remove unwanted elements, wires, rigs, tracking marks, and 360 cameras. Generate clean plates for massive time-savings.  The Remove Module is an amazing alternative to traditional clone and paint techniques for getting rid of unwanted pixels and removing objects. It automatically detects temporal clean frames to blend and align pixels with little user input. It's like Content Aware on steroids!",

"content4": "Render accurate match moves and screen inserts with realistic motion blur or mesh warp distortions.  Render graphics onto your tracked screen surface within Mocha Pro or back to your host timeline with new plug-in option. Combines with Lens Module for realistic VFX compositing on lens distorted footage.",
"image_url5": "",
"content5": "The stabilize module can lock down camera motion or stabilize moving objects based on planar tracking. Smooth option with selectable anchor frames helps reduce high frequency jitters while maintaining original camera motion. Center, scale or crop stabilized footage based on user driven tracking.",

"content6": "This simple and easy-to-use interface allows users to calibrate the distortion introduced by camera lenses. Unwanted lens distortion can be removed or matched for realistic compositing.",
"image_url7": "",
"content7": "Stereo 3D planar tracking, masking, and object removal workflow.  Mocha supports native stereo 3D and 360/VR stereo formats. This unique workflow uses planar tracking analysis on “both eye views” to reduce manual offsets and tedious keyframe work on stereo 3D rotoscoping, tracking, 3D camera solve, and object removal.",
"image_url8": "https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1570052340/products/Mocha%20Pro/CameraSolver_THUMBNAIL.png",
"content8": "Unlike feature based camera tracking, Mocha solves the 3D camera based on user-selected planar data. This fast and easy-to-use solution is ideal for set extensions, 3D text, and particle tracking. Additionally the 3D solver can be used to assist other 3D tracking applications on difficult shots with low detail or significant foreground occlusions."
