Title Studio features a modern fully-customizable custom user interface and hundreds of factory-installed professionally designed presets that are fully customizable and accessed via the integrated FX Browser.</p><p>Updates include improved handling of 3D models from Maxon Cinema 4D with support for more C4D shaders and materials. A new Texture Composite shader, which can be used to add material textures 3D objects with procedural generators, gradients, images, EPS files or even video clips from the filtered host timeline. A new Procedural Noise shader, which includes over a dozen texture types and 15 blending modes, can be used to generate custom materials that can be applied to any 3D element in Title Studio. These custom textures can be saved as new material assets in your Title Studio custom library for easy and quick retrieval in any Title Studio project.</p><p>Title Studio can be purchased as part of Continuum 2021, the 3D Objects Continuum Unit or as an individual Premium Filter.</p>"
