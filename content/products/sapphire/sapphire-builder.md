    "content": "A new and powerful feature of the Sapphire visual effects suite is the revolutionary Sapphire Builder, a node-based effect compositor that comes free with Sapphire. Builder can simplify your workflow by making it easy to create complex custom effects and transitions from scratch and then save these multi-layered effects as single instances, which then can be quickly applied elsewhere in your project. Watch how John Dickinson of Motionworks.com explains how he uses Sapphire Builder in his motion graphics work.",

      "content": "When Damien Leveck, writer/director, was looking to add top-notch visual effects to his award-winning short film \"The Cleansing Hour\", he knew Sapphire Builder was the way to go. \"The story revolves around a live-streamed exorcism that goes horribly wrong. Glitchy / YouTube-like compression effects were going to play a big part\", said Leveck. \"We always planned to present the film theatrically, so the premium look and feel of Sapphire effects really sold us early on. Also, using the Builder to create custom complex effects that were compatible between Avid and Resolve was a huge time-saver.\" \n",

Builder ships with over 150 pre-built “advanced presets”, so you can start using it right out of the box. When working in Builder, you have access to over 250 effects and more than 3000 presets, now filtered by common tasks, rather than effect name. For example, you can now search for “color correction” effects, “lighting” effects, or “text-based” transitions. This new way of browsing can be a massive timesaver when it comes to developing looks, grades, and custom effects. Once you start working with Builder, you will wonder how you ever managed working with effects without it. ",
