This empowers editors to do more advanced finishing work right within the filter without having to leave editing project timelines.\n\n<div id=\"ContentHide5\" style=\"display: none;\">Mocha can be used to generate user-defined closed spline shapes, which can be tracked individually or as a group using the Mocha planar tracker. These static or animated mask shapes can then be used to isolate the result of any filter to a specific region in the source shot (e.g., isolating a blur to someones face). The Mocha tracker can also be used to drive other filter parameters, such as screen / billboard replacement, face tracking, etc. \n\nFun Fact : Mask and tracking data from any Mocha session can be exported and used in any other Mocha session. This includes sharing tracking mask and tracking data from Mocha Pro and the integrated Mocha in Continuum, or even, Sapphire.\n\nFind out why Continuum customers who get a taste of Mocha lite in Continuum often [upgrade to the full version Mocha Pro](/products/mocha/why-mocha-pro-is-a-must-have-tool/).</div><br><button class=\"ContinuumcontentToggle\" id=\"ContentToggle55\">LEARN MORE</button>",
