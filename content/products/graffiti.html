         "content": "\nScalable vector art can now be imported directly into Graffiti. Users can add, delete, or modify the original spline points right within the Graffiti interface and the result can be extruded and animated in 3D space. The advantage to working with scalable vector art is that unlike raster art which is pixel based, vector art never suffers a loss in quality when it is resized or scaled. Most company logos are generated in this format.\n",
