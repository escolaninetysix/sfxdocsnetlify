    "content": "**Highlighted Effects Include:**\n<br>\n**Retime** - Smoothly slow down or speed up time with the Sapphire optical flow retimer.\n\n**TimeWarpRGB** - Shifts the red, green, and blue channels in time by different amounts to give a temporal chroma distortion.\n\n**TimeSlice**- Divides the output frame into slices, where each slice receives a different frame from the source clip.\n\n**TimeAverage** - Each output frame is the average of multiple input frames: from the current frame, back to a given number of previous frames\n\n**Cut To Dissolve** - Turns a cut without handles within a single clip into a dissolve.\n\n**RepairFrames** - Repairs one or more frames of a clip by replacing them with a time-warped version of the surrounding frames.\n\n**RandomEdits** - Randomly re-edits the entire source clip.  The shuffling is random but repeatable.\n\n**FieldRemove** - Adaptively removes video field interlacing artifacts from areas with motion, without blurring the stationary parts of the image. \n\n**Flicker** - Scales the colors of the source clip by different amounts over time for a flickering effect.\n\n**FlickerMatch** - Adds flicker to the Source clip using the flicker from a second Match clip.\n\n**FlickerRemove** - Removes temporal flickering from the Source clip\n\n**Feedback** - Frames are mixed from the past and future to create a beautiful feedback effect.\n<br>\n[See the list of all the effects included](/faq/sapphire-units-in-depth-descriptions/)\n\n[Read the Sapphire Units FAQ here](/faq/sapphire-units-faq/)\n"
