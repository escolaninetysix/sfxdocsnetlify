### FAQs

**Q. I purchased the VEGAS Movie Expansion Pack and I saw I got Boris plugins. Is this true?**

Yes! With every purchase of the VEGAS Movie Expansion Pack, you are entitled to receive a license to the Continuum Image Restoration Unit, the Particles Unit, and the Film Style Unit.

**Q. How do I get my Boris plugins?**

When you purchased the VEGAS Movie Expansion Pack, you received an email from VEGAS  which contained 3 Boris FX activation keys for the Continuum Image Restoration Unit, the Particles Unit, and the Film Style Unit . Fill out the form to activate your plugins.

**Q. Ok, I entered my Continuum activation keys, now what?**

After entering your 3 keys, you will receive an email with installation instructions and a link for the correct Continuum installer. Please be aware you must run the installer three times and enter each activation key separately.

**Q. All my plugins have a watermark on them. How do I fix this?**

Continuum is a suite of over 250 plugins. Your license for the VEGAS Movie Expansion Pack entitles you to license a small portion of our plugins. Upon installation, you are given the option to either “show all plugins” or “show licensed plugins”. Choose “show all plugins” to see everything Continuum has to offer, but be aware all unlicensed plugins will feature a watermark. If you choose to “show licensed plugins”, only the plugins you have licensed will be shown in the VEGAS video effects tab.

<strong id="link">Q. I had some older Boris plugins that disappeared. What happened?</strong>

Only one version of Boris FX plugins can be installed for VEGAS at any one time. So, if you have VEGAS Pro 18 with legacy Continuum plugins, these will be replaced with the newer versions that ship with VEGAS 20. We highly recommend uninstalling any existing Boris FX plugins previously installed on your system to avoid problems. To do this, right-click the Start button and click Control Panel. Go to Programs and Features (if your Control Panel is in Category view, go to Uninstall a Program). Find Boris FX Continuum, click to select it, and then click Uninstall. 

However, if you want to keep your older Boris FX plugins, then you do not install these current products as they will overwrite any older plugins. 

**Q. I love the Boris FX Continuum Units plugins for VEGAS! Can I upgrade to the full suite?**

Yes! VEGAS Movie Expansion Pack owners can upgrade to the full suite of Continuum plugins at the discounted price of $395.00. Please contact sales for more information.

**Q. Can I have a trial of Continuum for the VEGAS Movie Expansion Pack?**

Yes, we do offer a free 30 day watermarked trial of Continuum for VEGAS. We do not offer watermark-free trials of Continuum.

**Q. Can I use older plugins inside of VEGAS Pro 20?**

At this time, we only support Continuum 2021.5 for VEGAS. Customers who have upgraded to VEGAS 20 or the VEGAS Movie Expansion Pack and have older licenses of Boris Continuum plugins should contact sales for more information on upgrading to Continuum 2021.5.
