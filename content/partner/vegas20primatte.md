#### FAQ

**Q. I purchased VEGAS Post 20 or VEGAS Post 20 and saw I got Boris FX plugins. Is this true?**

Yes! With every purchase of VEGAS 20 Pro and Post, you are entitled to receive a license to Continuum Primatte Studio.

**Q. How do I get my Boris FX plugins?**

When you purchased VEGAS 20 Pro and Post, you received an email from VEGAS which contained a Continuum Primatte Studio activation key. Click here to activate your plugins.

**Q. Ok, I entered my Continuum Primatte Studio activation key, now what?**

After entering your key, you will receive an email with installation instructions and a link for the correct Continuum installer.

<strong id="link">Q. All my plugins have a watermark on them. How do I fix this?</strong>

Continuum is a suite of over 250 plugins. Your license for VEGAS Pro or Post 19 entitles you to license a small portion of our plugins. Upon installation, you are given the option to either “show all plugins” or “show licensed plugins”. Choose “show all plugins” to see everything Continuum has to offer, but be aware all unlicensed plugins will feature a watermark. If you choose to “show licensed plugins,” only the plugins you have licensed will be shown in the VEGAS video effects tab.

**Q. I had some older Boris FX plugins that disappeared. What happened?**

Only one version of Boris FX plugins can be installed at any one time. So, if you have VEGAS Pro 18 with legacy Continuum plugins, these will be replaced with the newer versions that ship with VEGAS 20. We highly recommend uninstalling any existing Boris FX plugins previously installed on your system to avoid problems. To do this, right-click the Start button and click the Control Panel. Go to Programs and Features (if your Control Panel is in Category view, go to Uninstall a Program). Find Boris FX Continuum, click to select it, and then click Uninstall. 

However, if you want to keep your older Boris FX plugins, do not install these current products as they will overwrite any older plugins. 

**Q. I love the Boris FX plugins for VEGAS Post 20! Can I upgrade to the full suite?**

Yes! VEGAS Post 20 owners can upgrade to the full suite of Continuum plugins at the discounted price of $395.00. Please contact sales for more information.

**Q. Can I have a trial of Continuum for VEGAS Post 20?**

Yes, we do offer a free 30 day watermarked trial of Continuum for VEGAS Pro. We do not offer watermark-free trials of Continuum.

**Q. Can I use older plugins inside of VEGAS Post 20?**

At this time, we only support Continuum 2021.5 for VEGAS 20. Customers who have upgraded to VEGAS 20 and have older licenses of Boris FX Continuum plugins should contact sales for more information on upgrading to Continuum 2021.5.
