As part of your VEGAS Pro 18 Suite purchase, you're receiving the following Continuum Units: Particles, Film Style, Image Restoration, and the free Particle Illusion standalone application. 

These units add a tremendous amount of functionality to VEGAS Pro and can easily add professional quality effects to any situation.

Please note: [Boris FX Continuum](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/?utm_source=vegas&utm_medium=landing&utm_campaign=vegas-17&utm_content=continuum) is a set of over 250 plugins with many features. Your purchase of VEGAS Pro 18 Suite entitles you **only to the Continuum Particles Unit, Film Style Unit, Image Restoration Unit, and free Particle Illusion standalone application.**

Watch the installation video above for instructions on hiding all unlicensed filters when installing your free Continuum Units. During installation, please have the three Boris FX activation keys that were provided in the VEGAS Pro 18 Suite purchase email for installation. You will need to run the Continuum installer for each activation key (a total of three installations) to license all three Continuum units.

We highly recommend **uninstalling any Boris FX plugins** before installing to avoid problems. To do this, right-click the Start button and click Control Panel. Go to Programs and Features (if your Control Panel is in Category view, go to Uninstall a Program). Find Boris FX Continuum, click to select it, and then click Uninstall. 

After registering, you will be emailed a link for the installer.
