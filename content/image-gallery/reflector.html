<p>One of the oldest and still most popular means of lighting an exterior set is by taking a reflective surface and redirecting sunlight or artificial light exactly where it is needed. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible for actors to keep their eyes open when looking into a reflector, resulting in squinting eyes. Our silver and gold reflectors allow you to add white or gold light into shadow areas without the squinting.</p>
