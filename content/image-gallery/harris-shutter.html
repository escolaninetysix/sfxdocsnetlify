<p>Invented by Robert S. “Bob” Harris of Kodak, the Harris Shutter was originally a strip device with three color filters used for making color photographs with the different primary color layers exposed in separate time intervals in succession. The same frame of film was re-exposed through red, green and blue filters in turn, while keeping the camera steady. Our digital version of the Harris Shutter can use separate images for the red, green and blue channels or offset the individual channels of a sequence in time. Offsetting the channels creates a rainbow of color around any object that moves within the frame. Some good candidates for subjects include waterfalls, clouds blowing over a landscape or people walking across a busy street.</p>
