<p>Day for Night simulates a technique used for shooting exteriors in daylight made to look like they were photographed at night. Typically, it involves underexposing by two to two-and-a-half stops and using a filter to provide a tint, that is often a lavender-blue, as it mimics twilight and appears to emulate the mood of moonlight.</p>
