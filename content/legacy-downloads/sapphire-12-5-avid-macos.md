**To Download and install:**

1. Make sure you have one or more of the following Avid products:

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>Media Composer Â </td>

<td>2.0 or greater</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Symphony</td>

<td>1.0 or greater</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Xpress Pro</td>

<td>5.0 or greater</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

1. Make sure you are running Mac OS X 10.8 or greater.
2. Quit your Avid software if it is running. If you have an older version of Sapphire v6 or v7 or v8 or v9 or v10 you do _not_ need to un-install it. The new installation will just replace it without removing any existing serial number.
3. Download and run the installer.

Follow the instructions given by the installer. When it asks for your username and password, just enter your Mac user login password.

Sapphire v12 should load all old sequences saved with older Sapphire versions, including v1 - v11.

Sapphire 12 is an <small>AVX</small>2 plug-in. Avid has deprecated support for the old <small>AVX</small>1 interface, but <small>AVX</small>2 plug-ins can read old sequences saved with <small>AVX</small>1 plug-ins.

When you restart your Avid software, the new version v10 plug-ins should appear in the Effect Palette in the **Sapphire** categories. You can simply use these effects just as you would any other effect.

For on-line help installed locally on your workstation, go to the Applications folder, double click on **GenArtsSapphire<small>AVX</small>** and select the online documentation. A "Help" dialog is also provided when using a plug-in, which gives information about that plug-in currently being used.
