<hr>

The installer below is for use with all AE compatible products including After Effects and Premiere Pro.

For Fusion, please use the OFX version instead.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">To Download and install:</span>

1. Make sure you have one or more AE plug-in compatible applications on Windows.
2. If you have an older version of Sapphire Plug-ins, the new installation will replace it, and you do not need to un-install it first.
3. Quit AE or other host applications that may be running.
4. Download the Windows installer.
5. Either run the installer program from its current location, or save it to disk and then execute it from wherever you saved it. Follow the instructions given by the installer.
6. Restart your host application, and the new plug-ins should appear in your effects menu.

To view on-line documentation after you install the software, go to Start -> All Programs -> GenArts Sapphire AE -> Online Help (HTML) or (PDF). You can also click on the "About" box while using any plug-in.

In general, you can load projects saved with older versions of Sapphire effects and they should automatically convert to use Sapphire v12. Please visit the support page for more info on this.

If you already installed Sapphire v12 and want to go back to an earlier version you should first uninstall v11.

### What's New In Sapphire 2019.01
<br>
#### New Effect- PixelSort (Stylize Category)
+ S_PixelSort is a damage effect that sorts the pixels in the image along different patterns of lines. There are three modes: "Linear" sorts along parallel lines, "Radial" sorts along lines radiating from a controllable center point, and "Circular" sorts along concentric circles. PixelSort sorts the pixels based on the relative values of the pixels that are over or under the specified threshold.

#### New Effect- WhipLash (Transition Category)
+ S_WhipLash is a new transition that is an enhanced, modern 2D version of Swish3D. It pans between frames of the transition input clips while applying motion blur as well as allowing the RGB channels to be split for a chromatic aberration look.


#### LensFlare Improvements
+ More than 25 new, high-quality LensFlare presets added.
+ New workflow with the preset browser embedded in the Flare Designer -- provides a live preview while browsing flare presets.
+ New controls and features on the Gradient controls inside the Flare Designer.
+ New "Components" - special complex elements to make creating advanced flares easier.
+ New MultiStreak element.
+ Several new controls for MultiStreak and MultiSpot.
 
#### Builder Improvements (After Effects, Premiere, Resolve, and Avid Only)
+ New Animated Shape node.
+ New Builder Presets for S_Effect and S_Transition including "Hand-drawn" transitions. 

#### GPU improvements
+ Optimized performance for Nvidia CUDA cards in Blackmagic Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro CC.

#### Mocha Improvements
+ **Mocha Essentials UI** - Mocha now offers a set of UI workspace options to let you choose the UI experience that best suits the task at hand. It opens up by default in the new Essentials mode which presents a simpler UI layout - perfect for standard tracking tasks. The original Mocha UI with all the bells and whistles is still available by choosing the Classic workspace from the menu on the top along with Roto and Big Picture workspaces.
+ **Mocha Magnetic and Freehand Drawing Tools** - New Magnetic spline tools will automatically snap to contours in the image making it vastly quicker to roto complex objects. The new Freehand drawing tools also allow freehand tracing of masks for quick loose masking.
+ **Mocha Primitive Shape Tools** - New Circular and Rectangular tools for simple creation of primitive shape masks.
+ **Mocha UI Enhancements** - Full support for High DPI monitors on windows and improved Retina support on Mac along with numerous additional UI enhancements.
