1. Quit your Avid software if it is running. If you have an older version of Sapphire v1 - v10 you do _not_ need to un-install it. The new installation will just replace it without removing any existing serial number.

* Download and run the installer.

  Either run the program from its current location, or save it to disk and then execute it from wherever you saved it. Follow the instructions given by the installer.

Sapphire v11 should load all old sequences saved with older Sapphire versions, including v1 - v10.

Sapphire 11 is an <small>AVX</small>2 plug-in. Avid has deprecated support for the old <small>AVX</small>1 interface, but <small>AVX</small>2 plug-ins can read old sequences saved with <small>AVX</small>1 plug-ins.

When you restart your Avid software, the new version v11 plug-ins should appear in the Effect Palette in the **Sapphire** categories.

For on-line help installed locally on your workstation, go to: **Start** -> **Programs** -> **GenArts Sapphire <small>AVX</small>** -> **Online Help**. A "Help" dialog is also provided when using a plug-in, which gives information about that plug-in currently being used.
