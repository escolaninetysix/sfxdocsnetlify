The installer below is for use with all AE compatible products including After Effects and Premiere Pro.

For Fusion, please use the OFX version instead.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">To Download and install:</span>

1. Make sure you have one or more AE plug-in compatible applications on Windows.
2. If you have an older version of Sapphire Plug-ins, the new installation will replace it, and you do not need to un-install it first.
3. Quit AE or other host applications that may be running.
4. Download the Windows installer.
5. Either run the installer program from its current location, or save it to disk and then execute it from wherever you saved it. Follow the instructions given by the installer.
6. Restart your host application, and the new plug-ins should appear in your effects menu.

To view on-line documentation after you install the software, go to Start -> All Programs -> GenArts Sapphire AE -> Online Help (HTML) or (PDF). You can also click on the "About" box while using any plug-in.

In general, you can load projects saved with older versions of Sapphire effects and they should automatically convert to use Sapphire v13. Please visit the support page for more info on this.

If you already installed Sapphire v13 and want to go back to an earlier version you should first uninstall v13.

### What's New In Sapphire 2020.02
* RackDefocus, Convolve, Glare, Flashbulbs: Fixed a slowdown in these effects when run on the CPU with certain parameter settings.
* Licensing: Improved license activation and deactivation where licensing one machine would deactivate another on certain network configurations.
* After Effects: Fixed a bug where the pivot in LensFlare and other point widgets might not be positioned correctly when the preview is downsampled.
* Preset Browser: Fixed an issue where the preset browser won't launch on large footage. For now the preset browser will use sample footage when the input clip is too large.
* Minor License Tool UI improvements.

* Mocha on macOS: To close Mocha, press command-q shortcut key or select Quit from File menu.
* Licensing: Improved license activation and deactivation where licensing one machine would deactivate another on certain network configurations.

### Whatâ€™s New in Sapphire 2020


**New Effect and Transitions**

* S_FreeLens- Brand new effect for Sapphire 2020, S_FreeLens emulates the look achieved by shooting with a lens detached from the camera body.

* S_OCIOTransform- New for Sapphire 2020, OCIOTransform brings OpenColorIO support directly into the host.


**New Features**

* In Sapphire 2020, Mocha point parameter tracking has been added to LensFlare, Rays, EdgeRays, Luna, Grunge, Spotlight, Aurora, Zap, MuzzleFlash, and FreeLens.

* Performance improvements have been added to various effects including EdgeRays, WhipLash, and SwishPan.

* Various performance improvements in the Preset Browser.

* Compare Mode has been added to the Sapphire Preset Browser, Sapphire Flare Designer, and Sapphire Effect and Transition Builder.

* OpenColorIO support has been added the Sapphire Preset Browser, Sapphire Flare Designer, and Sapphire Effect and Transition Builder.

* Improved Mocha: Area brush for quick masking.

**Known Issues**

* If the Preset Browser is launched multiple times in rapid succession inside the Sapphire Effect Builder, selection may not work in the preset browser.  If this happens close the Preset Browser and re-open it.

* Premiere: Point widgets may respond slowly in Premiere after a Mocha point track has been created.

* Mocha: The command-q shortcut key doesn't immediately respond when trying to close Mocha.  If the key is held down for 1-2 seconds, it will correctly close Mocha.

* Mocha: The Mocha UI does not correctly locate the default OCIO config file shipped with Sapphire.  To use the default OCIO config file shipped with Sapphire, use the OCIO environment variable to locate said the config file.
