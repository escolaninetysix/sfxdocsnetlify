**To Download and install:**

1. Make sure you have one or more of the following OFX compatible host products on Mac:

   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

   <tbody>

   <tr>

   <td style="width: 355px;"><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Resolve</span></td>

   <td style="width: 388px;"><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">10 or greater</span></td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

   <td style="width: 355px;">Nuke</td>

   <td style="width: 388px;">6.3v8 or greater</td>

   </tr>

   <tr>

   <td style="width: 355px;">Baselight   </td>

   <td style="width: 388px;">4.3 and 4.4 only</td>

   </tr>

   </tbody>

   </table>
2. Quit any host applications that may be running.
   If you previously installed an older version of Sapphire Plug-ins, the new installation will just replace it. You should not need to uninstall it first.
3. Download the Mac installer.
   This includes Universal 64 bit binaries for Mac Intel hardware.
4. Run the installer. When it asks for your passphrase, enter your Mac user login password, and follow the instructions given by the installer.
5. Restart your host product, and the new plug-ins should appear in your effects menu.

To view on-line documentation after you install the software, go to the /Applications/GenArtsSapphireOFX folder and double click on Online Help.html or Online Help.pdf. You can also click on the "Help" button while using any plug-in.
