}

<div style="color: #222222;">In your command line, install Mocha Pro. Either the node-locked or Floating License Managercan be installed with the command:</div>
<pre style="color: #222222;">sudo rpm -Uvh --nodeps Mochapro-5.0.0....rpm</pre>
<div style="color: #222222;">No other package installation is necessary, the Mocha Pro software should work. However, the License Manager does have an undeclared dependency that needs to be resolved. To install it, use the following command:</div>
<pre style="color: #222222;">sudo rpm -Uvh LicenseManager-1.4.0...rpm</pre>
<pre style="color: #222222;">sudo yum installredhat-lsb-core</pre>
