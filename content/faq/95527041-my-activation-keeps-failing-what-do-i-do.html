<div class="hidden-faq" id="ActFail">
<ul>
<li>Make sure you click "Verify" before you click "Activate" in the registration window or the message "activation failed" will appear.</li>
<li>If you have a firewall set up, you may not be able to connect to the Boris FX server resulting in the "activation failed" message. You may want to modify your firewall to allow your system to contact our server or, as an alternative, use UPID activation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you once again for your Boris FX Purchase.</p>
