### License Troubleshooting

1. It is important that your Optics software matches your activation code, so check your purchase order to make sure everything matches up version wise. It may be that you don’t have the correct version of Optics installed from our download section. This is especially important for legacy software.

2. Check to make sure you are not restricted to using certain ports due to a firewall or other admin permissions. When in doubt, temporarily turn your firewalls off for the duration of the installation and then turn them back on when you are done.

3. Troubleshoot your machine; try uninstalling all your Optics software, restarting your machine, and installing the software again from scratch, and make sure you follow installation directions off our website exactly. It sounds redundant, but sometimes it’s a great way to figure out what is going on inside your machine.

4. If all else fails, our support team is happy to help you figure this out. Please contact support.
