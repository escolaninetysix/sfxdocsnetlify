<p><strong> Subject </strong> : BCC Suddenly Having Problems On Windows</p>
<p><strong> Issue </strong> : My BCC Is Suddenly Experiencing Problems On My Windows System; Reinstalling Does Not Help</p>
<p><strong> Cause </strong> : Recent Changes, Manual Or Automated, Have Caused A Corruption in BCCʼs Behavioral Protocols</p>
<p><strong> How to Get Around the Issue </strong> :</p>
<p>1. Close your Host NLE/Compositor program and go into this directory - <br> C:\Users\[Current User]\AppData*\Local\BorisFX</p>
<p>2. Inside here, you will see a folder for Boris Continuum Complete -- send this folder to the Recycle Bin and re-launch your NLE/Compositor program. The problem should not come up with any new effects.</p>
<p>*Note:  The AppData folder mentioned above is hidden by Default in most installations of Windows 7 and Window 8 (even the Win 7/8 Professional version).  If you do not see this folder, you can go into the address field above and add “\AppData” and hit Enter - this will give you access to this hidden folder.</p>
