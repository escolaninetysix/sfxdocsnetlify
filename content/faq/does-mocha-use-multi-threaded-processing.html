<span style="color: #222222;">We only multi-thread some of the processes in Mocha at this time. Performance improvements are on the development list to speed up a lot of the workflows.</span><span style="color: #222222;">We will let our users know when we are able to utilize multi-threadding on all of our processes, but that will take time to implement.</span>
