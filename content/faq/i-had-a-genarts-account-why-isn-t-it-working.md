Imagineer Systems, GenArts and Boris FX joined forces in 2016 to deliver our customers awesome VFX plug-ins together. As we are one company now, we are consolidating our systems and resources. While we redirected the GenArts and Imagineer Systems websites, we still have your account information! It's only the website and login process that changed.

<hr>

**Will my existing GenArts or Imagineer Systems account information carry over?**

Yes. Your account information will carry over as long as you create your new Borisfx.com account with the same email address you used for your GenArts or Imagineer Systems account.

<hr>

**Can I reuse my old login credentials?**

Use the same email address. This will help us populate your Boris FX account with your prior GenArts or Imagineer Systems activity. We recommend changing your password.

If you can not use the same email address as you used for your GenArts or Imagineer Systems account, you will need to [contact us](/company/contact-us/) to link your prior account information with your new Borisfx.com account.

<hr>

**I have an account with BorisFX.com already, can I just login with that?**

Yes. We already linked your account to your GenArts or Imagineer Systems activity provided that you are using the same email address for your login as you used for GenArts or Imagineer Systems. Â If you are using a different email address, you will need to [contact us](/company/contact-us/) for assistance.

<hr>

**I am having trouble logging in, what should I do?**

Make sure you have 1) [setup your account](/account/login/), and 2) verified your email by clicking on the verification link in the email sent to your email address when the account was setup. If you didn't receive the verification email, please check to see if it went into your spam.

If you have completed the two steps above, try resetting your password.
