Understanding the planar tracker is key to getting a good track. Increasing the <strong>Min % of Pixel Used</strong> in the track tab can also help. If your tracker is simply not working properly, there could bea corrupt file in your cache. Delete the contents of your cache folder. You can find your cache folder in your Preferences: <strong>File&gt;Preferences</strong> wherever you have set it to, but usually somewhere like “C:/MoTemp/”. Delete the cache folder contents and restart <strong>Mocha</strong>.
