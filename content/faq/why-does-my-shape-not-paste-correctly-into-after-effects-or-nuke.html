If your <strong>Mocha</strong> shape does not lineup in your destination software, you may have a mismatched project frame rate or aspect ratio. If you are seeing stranger results, the track for that shape may have become corrupt. A good way to check this is to turn the surface tool on and see if the surface tool does anything unexpected, like disappear. You may need to re-track the object.
