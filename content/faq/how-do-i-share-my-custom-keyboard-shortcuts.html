}

Our custom user keyboard shortcuts are designed to be shared, but if you want to share the default settings (AE, Nuke, Etc) you'll need to make a copy of them first. You can find your saved keyboard profiles here: Linux: ~/.config/Imagineer Systems Ltd/ Mac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/Imagineer Systems Ltd/ Windows: [YourUserName]\AppData\Roaming\Imagineer Systems Ltd
