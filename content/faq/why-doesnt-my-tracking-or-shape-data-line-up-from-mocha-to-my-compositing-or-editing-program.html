When you paste or importyour <strong>Mocha</strong>data into the final composite or edit, make sure you are pasting or loading your data in at the first frame of the clip, otherwise your data will not line up. Project settings such as <strong>frame rate</strong>, <strong>dimensions</strong> and <strong>pixel aspect ratio</strong> must be match between your <strong>Mocha</strong> project and your destination software.Make sure these values match the settings in your compositor or editor and inside of <strong>Mocha</strong>, otherwise your tracking data will not match when you export it. If your are using Adobe After Effects, thetarget layer you are pasting data to should also be the same size as your AE composition. A good After Effects troubleshooting tip: create a new solid that is the same size as your composition. Paste your track or roto shape data to this layer. If it does not line up, the issue is mostly likely a project mismatch.
