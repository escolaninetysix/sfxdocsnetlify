You most likely have the wrong program installed. Please make sure you install the exact product your activation code is for. This is found in your purchase email. <strong>Please note: </strong>If you are running the Adobe After Effects bundled version of<strong> Mocha AE</strong>,<strong></strong>updates are provided by Adobe. Installing a download from the Imagineer site, requires an upgrade purchase. Still confused?<a title="Contact Support" href="/support/open-a-case/" target="_blank">Email us</a> and we are glad to walk you through the options.
