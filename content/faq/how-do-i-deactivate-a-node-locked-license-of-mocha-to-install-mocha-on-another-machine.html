Every <strong>Mocha</strong>node-locked purchase includes 2 license activations. No deactivation is necessary, simply uninstall <b>Mocha</b> from the machine. If you have run out of license activations, please <a title="Contact Support" href="/support/open-a-case/">contact support</a> to request a license transfer. If you are working in a facility and wish to run <strong>MochaPro </strong>on more than one CPU, you might be interested in upgrading to a cross-platform, floating license. Please <a title="Contact Sales" href="http://www.imagineersystems.com/purchase/contact-sales/" target="_blank">contact our sales team</a>for more info.
