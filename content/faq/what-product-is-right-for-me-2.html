<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Q. I am not sure the differences between your products. Which do I choose?</span></strong> <strong>A.</strong>With the <strong>Mocha Pro 5</strong> release we have simplified our offering. Choose from the <strong>Mocha Pro</strong><strong>plug-in</strong> or <strong>standalone</strong> options. The&nbsp;<a title="Compare" href="/products/compare-products/">compare products chart </a>&nbsp;shows the differences between <strong>Mocha Pro 5 </strong>and the Adobe &amp; HitFilm bundled <strong>Mocha</strong> products (<em>Mocha AE / Mocha HitFilm</em>).
<hr>
<strong>Q. Do I need the standalone or the plug-in option?</strong> A. The standalone and the plug-in option share an almost identical feature set and the ability to export tracking and roto data to most popular formats. The main difference: the plug-in runs inside your host application and uses the host's media engine whereas the standalone does not require a host software. If you only use only Adobe AfterEffects &amp; Premiere OR Avid, you may only require the Adobe or Avid specific plug-in. If youuse Adobe, Avid, Nuke, Resolve or Fusion, you many want the Multi-host option. If you have dedicated roto and tracking artists OR want to build an assistant station dedicated to <strong>Mocha Pro</strong>, choose the standalone option. Please note: the <strong>Mocha Pro 5</strong> plug-in is not available as a floating license. If you have a large site that requires floating licenses, please&nbsp;<a title="Contact Sales" href="/store/contact-us/">contact&nbsp;our&nbsp;sales&nbsp;team</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;pricing.
