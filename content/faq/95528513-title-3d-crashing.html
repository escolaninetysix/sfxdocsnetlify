<p><strong> Issue </strong> :  Title 3D crashing Final Cut Pro when applying, launching or rendering.</p>
<p><strong> Steps to work around the issue: </strong></p>
<p>1. Quit Final Cut Pro and go to this location in the Finder -Macintosh HD :: Users :: [ Current User/Home ] :: Library** :: Preferences</p>
<p>2. Inside this location, delete the file that reads: “com.borisfx.Title 3D”</p>
<p>3. Inside the same Preferences folder, enter the Final Cut Pro User Data directory and delete these two files: ʻFinal Cut Pro Obj Cacheʼ &amp; ʻFinal Cut Pro Prof Cacheʼ After this, re-launch Final Cut Pro and Title 3D should be operational again.</p>
<p>*Note: this folder is hidden by default in later versions of OSX.  In order to access this folder, you will need to enable view of hidden objects in OSX, or load it from the 'Go' menu.</p>
