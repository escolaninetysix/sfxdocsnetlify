<p><strong> Subject </strong> : Poor Performance with Static BCC Wild Cards Effect</p>
<p><strong> Issue </strong> :  When Previewing or Rendering Static Instances of BCC Wild Cards, The Performance Is Notably Slow</p>
<p><strong> Cause </strong> :  The BCC Wild Cards Is Processing Unnecessary Information</p>
<p><strong> How to Get Around the Issue </strong> :</p>
<ol>
<li>During Preview at least (and possibly during Render), dis-engage the Anti-Aliasing function completely.  </li>
<li>Turn off the Motion Blur if enabled.</li>
<li>Set the Back Face to None, as these two functions are being processed despite not carrying out any visual alteration to the effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: if you wish to use this effect in conjunction with another clip or visual effect (such as Glow or Glare), it would be recommended to either Pre-Comp or PreRender the BCC Wild Cards effect before applying additional elements.</p>
