**What happens if I have a legacy version of the full Continuum suite installed and I downloaded a Premium Filter?**

If you have previously installed any version of Continuum in any host application, please be aware that all Premium Filters are part of Continuum 11 and will overwrite all plug-ins associated with older versions of Continuum, replacing all older versions of Continuum plug-ins with the Premium Filter. For customers who own Continuum v10 and prior, we strongly encourage you to call in to 1-888-77-BORIS or [click here](/store/contact-us/) to speak to a sales associate about upgrading to Continuum 11.

**I am an Avid Media Composer subscriber. Can I use a Premium Filter alongside BCC Lite?**

A Premium Filter is part of Continuum 11 and cannot be installed alongside BCC Lite. Installing it will replace and erase all of BCC Lite. For customers who are Avid Media Composer subscribers and wish to use a Premium Filter alongside BCC Lite, we encourage you to call in to 1-888-77-BORIS or [click here](/store/contact-us/) to  speak to a sales associate about a free upgrade to the newest version of BCC lite.

**Is there technical support offered with Premium Filters?**

For any and all questions about the Premium Filters, including installation, usage, and troubleshooting, users can post questions online in the [Boris FX public forums](https://forum.borisfx.com/c/continuum-11).

***

**Are Premium Filters offered with a perpetual license or subscription?**

Premium Filters are offered as perpetual (node-locked) licenses only. Subscription pricing is offered for the full Continuum suite only.

***

**What hosts are supported for Premium Filters?**

Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, Apple FCP X & Motion, Avid Media Composer, Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve, Magix Vegas Pro, Foundry Nuke, and other supported OFX hosts.

***

**If I have two host applications installed on the same machine, say Avid and Premiere, will a Premium Filter work in both?**

Yes, Premium Filters are cross-host, meaning you can use it for all supported hosts that are installed on the same machine, as long you install all the correct installers.

***

**Do I need to be connected to the internet to activate a Premium Filter license?**

Yes, you need an internet connection to license a Premium Filter. Offline license activation is not supported for Premium Filters. If you require offline activation, you need to license [the full Continuum suite](/products/continuum/).

***

**Will a Continuum Premium Filter unit work forever?**

The license will never expire. We cannot always guarantee that legacy versions of Continuum will work with future OS and host versions. For this reason, we strongly recommend always maintaining the [current version of Continuum](/products/continuum/).
