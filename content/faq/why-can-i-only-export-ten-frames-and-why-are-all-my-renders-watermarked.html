You are running <strong>Mocha</strong> in learning edition (LE) mode. In LE mode, exports are limited to 10 frames andrenders have watermarks on them. LE mode exists so that you can continue to learn <strong>Mocha</strong> even after your 15 day trial has expired. If you are running on a floating license and you see the that you are running in LE mode, all your licenses have been checked out. If you have been working on a file on a node-locked license and you lose your license to another user, <i>do not save your file in LE mode</i>. If you have saved your file, you will have to send it to our support team to be unlocked. Be advised, it may take anywhere from 24-72 hours to unlock your LE mode files. Keep your splash screen on if you are running floating licenses so that you can look out for this warning: “<span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning! You are Running in LE Mode.</span>”
