This can occur if Sapphire plugins are not installed properly, or they were copied over from another machine instead of being installed at all. The solution is to just re-install from [https://borisfx.com/downloads/?&product=Sapphire&host=Autodesk](https://borisfx.com/downloads/?&product=Sapphire&host=Autodesk).
