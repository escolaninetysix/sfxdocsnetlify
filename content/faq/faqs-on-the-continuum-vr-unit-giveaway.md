**What happens if I have a legacy version of the full Continuum suite installed and I downloaded a Continuum 11 VR unit?**

If you have previously installed any version of Continuum in any host application, please be aware that the Continuum VR Unit is part of Continuum 11 and will overwrite all plug-ins associated with older versions of Continuum, replacing all older versions of Continuum plug-ins with the 5 VR filters. For customers who own Continuum v10 and prior, we strongly encourage you to call in to 1-888-77-BORIS or [click here](/store/contact-us/) to speak to a sales associate about upgrading to Continuum 11.
