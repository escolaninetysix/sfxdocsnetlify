<b><a href="/products/mocha-pro/">Mocha</a>&nbsp;</b>does not support non-standard, custom frame-rates. You will need to use a different frame-rate, as close to your desired frame rate as possible, but convert your footage to individual frames instead of a movie. You will then be able to composite your shot and convert it to the proper frame rate of your choosing.
