<p><strong> Subject </strong> :  Boris RED/FX does not launch as Transition in FCP.</p>
<p><strong> Issue </strong> :  When user applies Boris RED/FX as a Transition in Final Cut Pro 7, the plugin is recognized but when called upon from the Viewer window, the interface does not load.</p>
<p><strong> Cause </strong> :  Intermittent limitation of old-style plug-in architecture.</p>
<p><strong> Steps to work around this issue </strong> : </p>
<p>NOTE:  Any one of these might be enough to get the interface to load, so it might work before you reach the end of list below.</p>
<p>1. Move the Playhead to the point of the specific Transition you are attempting to create/edit.</p>

<p>2. Highlight the Transition.</p>
<p>3. Go into your RT settings (located in your FCP System Settings) and make sure that your RT is set to ʻSafeʼ rather than ʻUnlimitedʼ.</p>
<p>4. If steps 1~3 do not work, delete the Transition and reapply it.</p>
<p>5. If steps 1~4 do not work, delete the ʻFinal Cut Pro Obj Cacheʼ &amp; ʻFinal Cut Pro Prof Cacheʼ files from this directory -</p>
