<p><br></p>This may be a conflict with your video card. If your shape is completely stationary, try going to <b><a href="/products/mocha-pro/">Mocha</a></b> and select File&gt;Preferences. Once preferences is open, navigate to the "Open GL" tab and check the checkbox "Disable Offscreen Buffers." Now try tracking again, your shape should follow the track properly.
