When you render in <strong>Mocha</strong>, renders are temporary cached image files in your <strong>Results Folder</strong>. If you close <strong>Mocha</strong> and un-check “retain cached renders” on exit, <strong>Mocha</strong> will delete all the temp files. We recommend that you export your rendered results to another output folder with File&gt;Export Rendered Clip for proper backup.
