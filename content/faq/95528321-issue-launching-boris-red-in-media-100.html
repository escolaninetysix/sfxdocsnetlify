<p><strong> Subject </strong> : Unable to Launch Boris RED in Media 100</p>
<p><strong> Issue </strong> :  When I apply Boris RED as a filter, Comp or Title, I receive an error that the Boris Graffiti or Boris FX file is missing.</p>
<p><a href="https://bfxcdn.s3.amazonaws.com/borisfx/wpborisfxuploads/2015/05/n3.jpg"> <img class=" size-medium wp-image-3833 alignright" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1222/4522/files/blog_n3-300x108.jpg?1620600229861654206" alt="n" width="300" height="108"> </a></p>
<p><strong> Cause </strong> :  The files for Boris RED need to be in a specific location in relation to Media 100.</p>
<p><strong> Steps to work around the issue </strong> :</p>
<p>1. Quit Media 100 and go into the Media 100 Folder folder in the Applications directory.</p>
<p>2. Check to confirm that Boris RED is located in all three of these folders - <br> Macintosh HD :: Applications :: Media 100 Folder :: Filters <br> Macintosh HD :: Applications :: Media 100 Folder :: Graphics <br> Macintosh HD :: Applications :: Media 100 Folder :: Transitions :: DVEʼs</p>
<p>3. If Boris RED is missing from any of these directories, manually Delete the Media 100 Folder by sending it to the Trash.</p>
<p>4. As an Admin-level User account, run the Disk Utility and reinstall Media 100.</p>
<p>If Boris RED is located inside these three folders, then conduct a search on your system to locate the Media 100 Suite application itself.If it is located anywhere else, such as the Desktop, you will need to place the Media 100 Suite application itself back into the Media 100 Folder in the <em> Applications </em> .Once the Media 100 Suite application is back in the Media 100 Folder, with Boris RED in the folders above, Boris RED will operate inside Media 100 once again.</p>
