}

<strong>Mocha</strong> has the ability to interpolate interlaced footage. This must be set up when you start your new project: <strong>separate fields</strong>. <strong>Please note:</strong> For rendering modules such as Remove, Insert and Stabilize, interlaced footage can be difficult to work with. Imagineerrecommends working inside <strong>Mocha</strong> on frame based clips. Consider processing interlaced footage into frame based , de-interlaced footage in another program. You may then remove and render out of <b>Mocha</b> at full size, making the remove tool work easily in your shot. You can then reprocess the clip to be interlaced once again.
