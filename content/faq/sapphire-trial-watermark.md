All free Sapphire trials have a watermark. The Sapphire trial version is a fully functional 30-day trial watermarked with a red X. We designed the watermark to be as unobtrusive as possible so the effects can be properly auditioned and experienced. After the 30-day trial times out, Sapphire will begin to render black frames. If you [purchase a Sapphire license](/store/?collection=sapphire&product=sapphire), the watermark will disappear and Sapphire will begin to render perfectly.
