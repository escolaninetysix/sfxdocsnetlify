<p><strong> Subject </strong> :  Jagged and/or Flickering Titles Made by Boris RED/Graffiti</p>
<p><strong> Issue </strong> :  My Titles Made in Boris RED/Graffiti are Jagged and/or Flickering When Rendered in My Host Application.</p>
<p><strong> Cause </strong> :  There are two settings in Boris RED and Boris Graffiti that re-adjust fields to optimize both vector and extruded text - Usually These Are Disabled, Causing These Problematic Renders; In Rare Cases, however, Having These Enabled Will Cause a Render Problem.</p>

<p><strong> Steps to work around the issue: </strong></p>
<p>1. Inside the Boris RED/Graffiti Interface, go into the Project Settings, accessible under the Edit menu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>2. Inside the Project Settings, you will see two check-boxes: “1:2:1 Deflickering” &amp; “Better Quality Field Rendering”.</p>
<p>For Titles, it is generally best to enable both of these settings.  However, as mentioned previously, there are rare instances where enabling one of these will cause a similar problem.  As such, it is recommended you toggle these settings, individually, to obtain optimal render.</p>
<p>3. If this does not fix the titles after a re-render, try rendering again, this time setting your Hostʼs Render Settings to a different Codec.</p>
