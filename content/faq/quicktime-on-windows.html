<span style="color: #222222;">If users have security concerns and do not want to use QuickTime on Windows, but still want access to .MOV and .MP4 codecs, we recommend that they uninstall QuickTime Player, and install only the QuickTime Essentials part of the package. This substantially reduces the attack surface and reduces QuickTime to the status of a faceless library on their system which will only be used inside of other software for codec decoding. For v5 users, the Mocha Pro 5 Plug-in option is the ideal solution because it has no dependency on QuickTime and reads the image data right out of the host's timeline. For users who are unable to upgrade to Mocha Pro 5 the Plug-in, installing the codecs alone will help solve some of the problems users are encountering with Quicktime on Windows.</span> If you have trouble installing only the QuickTime essentials, tryÂ <span style="color: #222222;">this method: </span>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">Fully uninstall QuickTime and delete any Apple folders left on your machine for a clean uninstall.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">Reinstall using the full installation option with the player installed as well.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">In your program management configuration panel, select the uninstall option and ask Quicktime to be "modified."</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">Uninstall Quicktime Player only but keep the full library of codecs you need to read .MP4 and .MOV files.</span></li>
</ol>
