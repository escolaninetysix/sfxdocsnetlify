You can use the same activation key on different machines provided you have enough number of fulfillments per activation. For instance, if you have an activation key for one machine, you can only activate it on one machine. If your activation key allows more than one activation, you may activate it on that many machines. In order to use it on a different machine, you will need to transfer your activation.
