<p><strong> Subject: </strong> Boris Product Displaying in English on Non-English OS</p>
<p><strong> Issue: </strong>   I have installed my Boris Product(s) on my Non-English Operating System, but the Boris displays in English, not the language of the Operating System.</p>
<p><strong> Cause: </strong>   All Boris programs will run in the native language for most Operating Systems, but this requires a file to be installed called the ʻBoris Language Pack.ecsʼ</p>
<p><strong> Steps to work around the issue: </strong></p>
<p>1. Close all Boris programs and host programs.</p>
<p>2. Re-run your Boris Installer - If you are on Windows, you will want to go with the ʻModifyʼ option (on the Mac this will come up automatically).</p>
<p>3. Inside here, enable the ʻBoris Language Packʼ install option and Continue.</p>

<p>4. When installation is complete, close the installer and re-launch your Boris program and/or host.</p>
