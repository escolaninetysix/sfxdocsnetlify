**QUESTION:** My favorite host application supports OFX plug-ins, will Sapphire work?

  
**ANSWER:** Sapphire VFX plug-ins work in many host applications that support OFX plug-ins, such as but not limited to:

* Assimilate Scratch
* China Digital Video DX and EX
* DigitalVision Nucoda and Phoenix
* HitFilm Pro
* SGO Mistika and Mamba
* Natron

With these applications, Sapphire is considered to work on an “as is” basis. We cannot guarantee full functionality due to specific host application limitations. Customers are strongly encouraged to try a [Sapphire trial](/downloads/?&product=Sapphire) before purchasing and should be aware there may be issues with future compatibility.
