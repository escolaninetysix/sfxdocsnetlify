<p><strong> Subject </strong> : One Frame Watermarks on BCC AVX 9 on Mac</p>
<p><strong> Issue </strong> : When I render my BCC AVX 9 effects, each effect has a watermark on the first frame.  This isnʼt visible before render, and the BCC AVX 9 software is fully licensed.</p>
<p><strong> Cause </strong> : Problematic Build</p>
<p><strong> How to Get Around the Issue </strong> :</p>
<p>This is a known problem with one particular Installer build that was sent to multiple channels.  If you are experiencing this problem, Quit Avid, Uninstall BCC AVX 9 and download this file: <a href="https://xfer.borisfx.com/BCCAVX902Mac64Bit.dmg"> https://xfer.borisfx.com/BCCAVX902Mac64Bit.dmg </a></p>
<p>Once you have downloaded this alternate installer, Reinstall BCC AVX 9 using this installer and re-render your effects; the BCC AVX Watermark will no longer appear on your existing clips, nor will it appear on any further ones.</p>
<p>Note: this will even work with timelines carried over from network systems.</p>
