In order to use clips (ie. not image sequences) you must have QuickTime installed.

<p style="color: #000000;">In the event that you are working in a format that&nbsp;<strong><span class="productname"><a href="/products/mocha-pro/">Mocha</a>&nbsp;</span></strong>doesn't support, we recommend converting the footage to an <strong>image sequence</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">If you are just tracking, you can use any compressed format such as a JPG sequence and then use your original footage when you apply the data. If you are going to be doing rendering, such as using<span class="productname">Mocha Pro's</span>remove or insert modules, then we recommend converting to a DPX or TIFF sequence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Make sure of the following when converting to an image sequence:</p>
<div class="orderedlist" style="color: #000000;">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1" compact="">
<li class="listitem">The frame rate, aspect ratio and dimensions are the same as the original footage.</li>
<li class="listitem">If you are creating proxy footage, make sure the aspect ratio and frame rate are the same.</li>
<li class="listitem">If you are using a particular bit depth, make sure you convert to the same depth if you are using the footage for rendering inside Mocha</li>
<li class="listitem">If using compressed footage, don't set the compression too low, as this will create artifacts that may hinder tracking and roto.</li>
<li class="listitem">Make sure&nbsp;<strong><span class="productname">Mocha&nbsp;</span></strong>supports the sequence you are converting to!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">If you would prefer to convert to a movie clip format then we recommend a standard format that QuickTime would understand, such as Animation. If you are working on OSX, ProRes can also be a good alternative.</p>
