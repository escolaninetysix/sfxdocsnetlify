If you are having issues with opening your preset browser on your Mac:

*	Check your hosts file inside /etc/hosts and make sure that there is a localhost line (127.0.0.1 localhost).
*	If localhost isn't in the hosts file, add the line "127.0.0.1 localhost" and save the file (this will require administrator privileges).
