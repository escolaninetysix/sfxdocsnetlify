<p><strong> Subject: </strong> Boris Displaying in My Operating Systemʼs Language Instead of English</p>
<p><strong> Issue: </strong>   My OS (Mac/Windows) is a non-English OS, and after installation, my Boris product is displaying in the same language as my OS.  Instead, I want my Boris product to display in English.</p>
<p><strong> Cause:  </strong> The Boris installer, detecting the non-English nature of the Operating System, installed a Translation file to translate the program to the Operating System's current language settings.</p>
<p><strong> Steps to work around the issue: </strong></p>
<p>1. Close Boris Programs and any Host NLE that might be running.</p>
<p>2. Go to the Boris FX, Inc. Folder -- On Mac OSX, this will be located inside the Application Support directory.  On Windows, this will be located in the Program Files (or current equivalent).</p>

<p>3. Delete the ʻBoris Language Pack.ecsʼ file &amp; Re-launch your NLE and/or Boris Program.</p>
