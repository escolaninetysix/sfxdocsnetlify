If you own <strong>Mocha Plus</strong> or <strong><a href="/products/mocha-pro/">Mocha Pro</a></strong>, you can open these products from within AE. To open Mocha Plus or Mocha Pro inside of After Effects the same way Mocha AE opens from After Effects, simply go to Mocha&gt;file&gt;preferences and open Mocha's preferences. Check "track in AE" and close Mocha. Restart After Effects and use Animation &gt; Track in Mocha AE as you normally would. The Plus or Pro version of Mocha will now open the same way Mocha AE used to.
