<span style="color: #222222;">That is caused by trying to use the incorrect activation code for you Mocha product. Make sure you have double checked your activation code, and make sure you have the right version. You usually see this when you have used license manager 1.2.5 for Mocha V4, are trying to activate a Mocha V3 software with a Mocha V4 code, or have substituted Mocha Pro for Mocha Plus.</span>
