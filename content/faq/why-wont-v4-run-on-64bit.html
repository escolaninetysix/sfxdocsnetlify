While older products supported 32 bit systems, Imagineer Systems license managers and <strong>Mocha v4</strong> are 64 bit only moving forward. Please pick a 64 bit machine to run <strong>Mocha </strong>on. Any machine on your network that is 64 bit can run <strong><a href="/products/mocha-pro/">Mocha</a></strong> and our license manager. This is in line with Adobe Products, many professional graphics applications, and other industry trends.
