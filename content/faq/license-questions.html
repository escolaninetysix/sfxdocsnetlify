<b>Q. How many computers can I install a license on?&nbsp;</b><div><p><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">A. Mocha Pro 5</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> now has an improved license system allowing users to activate or deactivate their software license while connected to the internet.

Simply "deactivate" your license to move it to a new system.

What is a floating license?&nbsp;<br></strong><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">A.&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A floating license is a license that can be shared across a networked group of computers. For example a 10-seat floating allows any 10 systems on the network the ability to can run the licenses at one time. In the situation when all 10 licenses are being used, further users will get errors on launching the software.
