<div id="SoundbiteFunctionalityIssue" class="hidden-faq">
<p><strong> Subject </strong> :  Soundbite loads but the functionality has stopped.</p>
<p><strong> Issue </strong> :  User is unable to Open files, Index folders, or Delete already Indexed folders.</p>
<p><strong> Cause </strong> :  This would be due to a corruption of the Soundbite protocols, which will need to be reset.</p>
<p><strong> Steps to work around this issue </strong> :</p>
<p>1. Close Soundbite, and go into this directory -Macintosh HD :: Users :: [ Current User/Home Folder ] :: Library* :: Preferences</p>
<p>2. Locate a file called “com.borisfx.Boris-Soundbite.plist” and delete it. <a href="https://bfxcdn.s3.amazonaws.com/borisfx/wpborisfxuploads/2015/05/g3.png"> <img class=" size-medium wp-image-3842 aligncenter" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1222/4522/files/blog_g3-300x89.png?15408629757275584905" alt="g" width="300" height="89"> </a></p>
<p>3. Afterwards, go into this directory -Macintosh HD :: Library :: Application Support :: Soundbite</p>
<p>4. Inside the Boris Soundbite folder, send the ‘Default’ files and the ‘Machine’ file to the Trash - Keep this folder open.</p>
