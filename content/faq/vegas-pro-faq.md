**Q. I purchased VEGAS Pro 20 and I saw that I get free Boris FX plugins. Is this true?**

Yes! With every purchase of the VEGAS Pro 20, you are entitled to receive a partial license to Continuum. 

**Q. How do I get my free Boris plugins?**

When you purchased VEGAS Pro 20, you received an email from VEGAS which contained 1 or multiple Boris FX activation keys. 

**Q. Ok, I entered my Continuum activation keys, now what?**

After entering your key(s), you will receive an email with installation instructions and a link for the correct Continuum installer.

**Q. All my plugins have a watermark on them. How do I fix this?**

Continuum is a suite of over 250 plugins. Your license for the VEGAS Pro 20 entitles you to license a small portion of our plugins. Upon installation, you are given the option to either “show all plugins” or “show licensed plugins”. Choose “show all plugins” to see everything Continuum has to offer, but be aware all unlicensed plugins will feature a watermark. If you choose to “show licensed plugins”, only the plugins you have licensed will be shown in the VEGAS video effects tab.

**Q. I had some older Boris plugins that disappeared. What happened?**

Only one version of Boris FX Continuum plugins can be installed for VEGAS Pro at any one time. So, if you have an older version of VEGAS with legacy Continuum plugins, these will be replaced with the newer versions that ship with VEGAS Pro 20. We highly recommend **uninstalling any existing Boris FX plugins previously installed on your system** to avoid problems. To do this, right-click the Start button and click Control Panel. Go to Programs and Features (if your Control Panel is in Category view, go to Uninstall a Program). Find Boris FX Continuum, click to select it, and then click Uninstall. 

However, if you want to keep your older Boris FX plugins, then **you do not install** these current products as they will overwrite any older plugins. 

**Q. I love the Boris FX Continuum Units plugins for VEGAS Pro 20! Can I upgrade to the full suite?**

Yes! VEGAS Pro 20 owners can upgrade to the full suite of Continuum plugins at the discounted price of $395.00. Please contact sales for more information.

**Q. Can I have a trial of Continuum for the VEGAS Pro 20?**

Yes, we do offer a free 30 day watermarked trial of Continuum for VEGAS Pro 20. We do not offer watermark-free trials of Continuum.

**Q. Can I use older plugins inside my latest version of VEGAS Pro 20?**

At this time, we only support the latest version of Continuum for VEGAS Pro 20. Customers who have upgraded and have older licenses of Boris Continuum plugins should contact sales for more information on upgrading.
