### Install Instructions - Windows

<a name="windows"></a>

The installer below is for use with OFX compatible products.

**To Download and install:**

1.  Make sure you have the OFX compatible application on Windows.
2.  Quit the OFX compatible host application that may be running.
3.  **[Download the 1.06 32-bit Windows installer](https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/store/particleIllusion-ofx-32-install-1.06.exe)** (22 Mb).  
    **[Download the 1.06 64-bit Windows installer](https://cdn.borisfx.com/borisfx/store/particleIllusion-ofx-64-install-1.06.exe)** (33 Mb).  
    Either run the installer program from its current location, or save it to disk and then execute it from wherever you saved it. Follow the instructions given by the installer.
4.  **[Download the additional emitter libraries Windows installer](http://files.genarts.com/particleillusion/pI_additional_emitter_libraries.exe)**<span> (81 Mb).  
    Download and install these after installing particleIllusion for OFX. The installer for particleIllusion for OFX includes just a single emitter library -- where the presets are contained. There are dozens of additional libraries consisting of over 3000 emitter presets available using the following installers.</span>
5.  Restart your host application, and the new plug-ins should appear in your effects menu.

**New in 1.06:**

*   Ensure emitter selection dialog appears above the application with Resolve host.
*   Ensure emitter preview restarts in emitter selection dialog if the same library is explicitly loaded with Load Library as the one that was already being used.
*   Allow the user to browse for an emitter library location in the emitter selection dialog if the current emitter library can no longer be found (e.g. if it was on a removable medium which has been removed). Give the user the choice of defaulting to Default.il3 as an alternative to finding a library by browsing.
*   Move the Help button to the first (Emitter) page or group of the UI to ensure the Help feature is always available even when pages or groups are completely hidden because they are not used by the selected emitter.

**New in 1.05:**
