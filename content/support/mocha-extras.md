<a href="/videos/send-to-mocha-script-for-nuke-installation-and-use/"><img src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/sendtomocha.png"></a>

Installation:

* Please read the README.txt in the zip file for installation instructions and the path to copy to your Nuke init.py script.
* When you run Nuke with this script you should see a mocha icon in the lefthand panel. To run the script:
* Select a read node in Nuke
* Click the mocha icon
* If Nuke asks you for the path to your mocha executable, browse to it (this will only be required once and then will be saved to /mocha/mochapath.txt)
* The script should then load mocha with the footage.

While this should work on your machine, we can’t guarantee that it will work with everyone’s version of python. Please [contact support](/support/) if you have any questions.
