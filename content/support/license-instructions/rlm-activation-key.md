The action of clicking the “License” button will launch the Boris FX License Tool. This mini-app will present you with a series of click-and-continue windows to guide you through the process of licensing the product. The  rst window that appears will prompt you to select the activation method.

If you already have your purchased license code and your system has an active / on-line connection to the internet, then select the  rst option as per the image below, then click the Continue button to proceed to the next window:

The next window which appears provides you with a window into which you can paste the license code that was sent to you when you purchased the product. To avoid the potential for any error when entering the license code, we suggest that you simply copy and paste using the standard system shortcuts (control / command + C and P), then click the Continue button to proceed to the final step:

**For Online Systems**

If your machine is connected to the Internet, choose to “Activate your license now. (Requires Internet connection.)”

<hr>

**For Offline Systems**

If your machine cannot connect to the Internet, you can activate using another computer's Web browser.

Choose to “Activate your license manually using another computer’s Web browser”:

* You will need to download and save the Continuum123456.key file that you received from your license email from a computer that has Internet connection.
* Transfer that Continuum123456.key file to your offline machine via a flash/thumb drive or a shared network.
* Follow the prompts to select the location of the key file.
* Pick a location for the request file (which will be created).
* Copy the request file (continuum.req) to a machine with Internet.
* Upload it to http://activation.borisfx.com/offline-activation.php.
* Save the activation file it returns (via download or email), and copy that back to the offline machine.
* Enter its location into to the license tool.

Only choose “Complete offline activation using an activation file you received.” if you have the Continuum.act file to upload, (this file is different than the Continuum123456.key file).

The next time you start up the host application (Adobe, Avid etc), the license should take effect.
