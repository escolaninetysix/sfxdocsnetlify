The **BCC 2D Particles** filter breaks the source image into particles and
disperses them in 2D space.

This filter also provides a variety of explosion, velocity, and gravity
controls to adjust the particles movement. You can also control the size,
shape, density, and opacity of the particles, and create custom particle
shapes and scatter wipes. Use the auto-animation feature to easily generate
explosion effects, or animate the filter manually for precise control.
