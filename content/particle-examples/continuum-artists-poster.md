  "description": "Video editors use the Continuum Artist Poster filter to create a posterized effect in your footage by decreasing the number of colors to red, green, blue, white, black, yellow, cyan, and magenta. "
}
The **BCC Artist’s Poster** filter creates a posterized effect by reducing the image to eight “pure” colors (Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, and White) and processing each color separately. At its default settings the filter outputs the NTSC-safe color that is closest to each of these eight colors.

The built in PixelChooser, with integrated Mocha planar tracking allows for greater control over which areas of the image the filter should affect.
