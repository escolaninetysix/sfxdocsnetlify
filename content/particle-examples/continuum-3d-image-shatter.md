The **BCC 3D Image Shatter** filter shatters the image in 3D space and
disperses the image fragments. The filter provides a variety of explosion,
velocity, and gravity parameters to control particle movement.

In addition, 3D Image Shatter has a number of parameters that allow you to
control:

  * Particle size and shape
  * Rotation
  * Opacity
  * Lighting
  * Explosion style.

This filter is auto-animated by default, but you can manually animate it for
more precise control over the movement and dispersion of the particles.
