The **BCC Beat Reactor** is a filter that can be used within Adobe After Effects to generate keyframes based on an audio track within the composition. These keyframes can be used to affect other parameters within the composition by using very simple AE expressions to link the generated keyframes to other parameters or by copying and pasting the generated keyframes to other parameters.

Beat Reactor displays a spectrum graphÂ including vertical bands representing the audio levels within various frequency ranges. This graph can be used to help target particular elements within the audio track for use in generating keyframes.

See a breakdown of the various controls and learn more about the [Beat Reactor filter](/documentation/continuum/bcc-beat-reactor/).
