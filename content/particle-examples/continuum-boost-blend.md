The **BCC Boost Blend** filter is a compositing filter that blends two
independent layers in a composition and adjusts contrast in the blended
pixels.

Unlike most transfer modes, Boost Blend adjusts the mix _only_ where the
source and blend layers are different. Boost Blend is especially useful when
you composite an image over itself and do not want the transfer mode to affect
areas where the blended pixels are identical to the source pixels.

The built in PixelChooser, with integrated mocha planar tracking allows for
greater control over which areas of the image the filter should affect.
