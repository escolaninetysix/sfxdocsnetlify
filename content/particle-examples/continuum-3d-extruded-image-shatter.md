The **BCC 3D Extruded Image Shatter** filter shatters the image in 3D space
and disperses the image fragments. Unlike the 3D Image Shatter filter, this
filter allows you to create three- dimensional particles with adjustable
extrusions.

The filter provides a variety of explosion, velocity, and gravity parameters to
control particle movement. In addition, 3D Extruded Image Shatter allows you
to control:

  * Particle size
  * Rotation
  * Opacity
  * Lighting
  * Explosion style.

This filter auto-animates by default, but you can manually animate it for more
precise control over the movement of the particles.
