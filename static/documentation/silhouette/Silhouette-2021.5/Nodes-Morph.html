Silhouette's morph node uses a “shape based” approach. Our company's founders include the inventors of this approach for which a Scientific and Technical Achievement Award was given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</div><div id="ww2581937" class="Body">Warping is a geometric or spatial distortion of an image. A morph is two or more synchronized warps composited together using location specific dissolve criteria specified by the artist.</div><div id="ww2581938" class="Body">As the term “shape based” implies, the artist creates shapes using the same tools as the Silhouette Roto node. In general, two shapes are paired together, one being the “source” and the other being the “target.” The exception to this can be an unpaired shape to be used as a “barrier.”</div><div id="ww2581939" class="Body">Silhouette warps source shapes to match target shapes (and in a morph, the target shapes simultaneously warp towards source shapes). As shapes warp, the image underneath the shapes (and surrounding areas) warp along as well as if the image were being stretched like a sheet of rubber.</div><div id="ww2581940" class="Body">Silhouette's warping technology provides a rich set of controls over the specific effect of the warp. These include the ability to precisely control correspondence between source and target shapes allowing the artist to specify not only that one shape should warp to another, but what part of the source shape to warp to what part of the target shape.</div><div id="ww2581941" class="Body">The Silhouette morph node also allows for the precise control over how shapes might fold over other shapes. Folding is a powerful feature which can best be understood by imagining pulling a blanket rather than a sheet of rubber. Snatching a piece of the blanket and pulling it can do one of three things. It can move the area of the blanket ahead of its motion out of the way. It can fold on top of the area in its way. Or, it can fold behind the area in its way.</div><div id="ww2581942" class="Body">All of these controls are necessary to create seamless, invisible effects.</div><div id="ww2581943" class="Head3"><span></span>Warps</div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2581944" class="Body">Image warping can take place on a still as well as moving images.

You could add a second correspondence point to halve the distance between vertices or you could increase the edge density to accomplish the same result. One method can be preferable to the other, for instance when there is an image feature, it would be logical to join from source to target with an additional correspondence point. If there isn't an image feature, simply increasing edge density means there is potentially less to keyframe. </div><div id="ww2582033" class="Body">Shapes whose source and target are physically very small relative to image size can actually benefit from reducing their edge density.</div><div id="ww2582034" class="Note">	<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">Note:</span> Edge Density determines how closely the perimeter of the rendered shape matches the original B-spline, X-Spline or Bézier shape.</div><div id="ww2582035" class="Head3"><span></span>Motion Blur</div><div id="ww2582036" class="Body">Motion blur is the directional blurring of rapidly moving shapes.

That is, which shape of a pair of joined shapes is considered to be the source and which is the target. When using a morph to transform one person’s face into another, it is necessary that you join the shapes from one image to another. For instance, the shapes for the eyes in the source image are joined to the shapes for the eyes in the target image, mouth shapes to mouth shapes, nose shapes to nose shapes--you get the idea. Without the joining process, Silhouette cannot know that shapes relate to each other.</div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582058" class="Body">Every joined shape has correspondence points which are only visible when using the Correspondence tool.

This precisely pins down the relationship between the shapes exactly where you need finer control.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/Nodes.07.099.15.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 241px; max-width: 416px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div id="ww2582114" class="Head4"><span></span>Getting Good Results</div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582115" class="Body">Let’s break down a complex use of correspondence points that gives the best possible results. Sophisticated correspondence point placement is especially necessary when there are multiple shapes in a small space, for instance where the eye outline is in close proximity to outlines for the iris and pupil.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/Nodes.07.099.16.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 240px; max-width: 416px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div id="ww2582120" class="Body">You will note that the eye outline has nine correspondence points.</div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582121" class="Body">The choice of these two sets of correspondence points is straight forward. They join the left-most eye points together and the right-most eye points together.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/Nodes.07.099.17.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 231px; max-width: 416px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582129" class="Body">The next example shows how the correspondence points are used to maintain the relationship between source and target features. In this case, correspondence points were placed in such a way as to bisect both pupils. Even though these correspondence points are not left-most or right-most or even the same distance around each eye surround, they represent logically connected features between the source and target.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/Nodes.07.099.18.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 239px; max-width: 420px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582135" class="Body">The last example shows how the relationship between the outline of each iris is maintained relative to the eye surround. These correspondence points are extremely important. The outline of each iris ends before it touches the eye surround. This is because the position of the iris outline is going to slide relatively against the eye surround. By not overlapping the iris outline and the eye surround, you are giving the image a little room to stretch without folding.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/11-cp-maintain-relationship.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 204px; max-width: 164px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582139" class="Body">You will be able to visualize where this type of sliding of two shapes against each other may present a problem using the wireframe preview.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/Nodes.07.099.20.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 219px; max-width: 524px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div id="ww2582148" class="Body">The arrows show where on the eye surround shape the iris shape connects. You can see how from frame 1 to frame 10, the place where iris meets the eye surround slides relative to the eye surround (compare to the position of the iris, for example).</div><div id="ww2582149" class="Head4"><span></span>Swapping Source and Target Shapes</div><div id="ww2582150" class="Body">When shapes are joined in the wrong order, they can be swapped using the Swap Joined option. To swap source and target shapes, select the Correspondence tool, select the source or target shape, right-click on the shape and choose Swap Joined from the pop-up menu.</div><div id="ww2582151" class="Head4"><span></span>Reverse Shape Orientation</div><div id="ww2582152" class="Body">Reverses the order of all control points on all keyframes. Similar to the Reverse option in the Reshape tool pop-up menu, Reverse Shape Orientation is useful when you are trying to join two shapes where the control points go clockwise in one and counter-clockwise in the other. In this case, the correspondence points would iterate in different directions and the lines would cross each other. Reversing the points of one of the shapes would make them go in the same direction and the correspondence would be correct.</div><div id="ww2582153" class="Head4"><span></span>Inserting Correspondence Points</div><div id="ww2582154" class="Body">To increase the precision of a complex shape, increase the number of correspondence points. To add a correspondence point, select the Correspondence tool and <span style="font-weight: bold">Alt</span>-click on a selected shape.</div><div id="ww2582155" class="Body">The edge density at the insertion point is effectively doubled by the addition of a new correspondence point.

These shapes are called barriers and tack down an area and keep it stationary relative to the warping caused by other shapes. Any unjoined shape will serve as a barrier.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/Nodes.07.099.21.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 161px; max-width: 283px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582171" class="Body">In the example above, the barrier shape will prevent any movement outside of the shape.

Notice in the image on the right, the model's lips have clearly extended over her coat and the coat did not move.</div><div id="ww2582179" class="Head2"><span></span>Folding</div><div id="ww2582180" class="Body">Sometimes the warping of a pair of joined shapes can overtake other shapes (joined or barrier). The overtaking shapes will necessarily fold over or under the shapes they overtake. For instance, you can warp eye lids over a pupil without distorting the pupil, as seen below.</div><div class="ww_skin_page_overflow"><div id="ww2582198" class="Body">The images below show how folding can affect an image.<img class="Default" src="https://borisfx-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1665681800/documentation-si/Silhouette-2021.5/images/Nodes.07.099.23.jpg" width="100%" style="display: block; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 284px; max-width: 407px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" title="" /></div></div><div id="ww2582199" class="Body">The choice of folding over or under is determined by the order of shapes in the Object List. In the above example, the source shape for the eye lid appears above the barrier shape for the pupil in the Object List. Therefore, the eye lid folds over the pupil.</div><div id="ww2582201" class="Body">Go to the <span style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold"><a href="../Silhouette-2021.5/Tutorials-Morphing.html#ww1630802" title="Morphing">Folding</a></span> tutorial to see how it works.</div><div id="ww2582202" class="Head2"><span></span>Node Outputs</div><div id="ww2582203" class="Head3"><span></span>Output</div><div id="ww2582204" class="Body">Outputs the result of the morph or warp transformation.</div><div id="ww2582205" class="Head3"><span></span>Source Warp</div><div id="ww2582206" class="Body">Outputs the source warp.</div><div id="ww2582207" class="Head3"><span></span>Target Warp</div><div id="ww2582208" class="Body">Outputs the target warp.</div><div id="ww2582209" class="Head3"><span></span>Objects</div><div id="ww2582210" class="Body">Outputs tracked layers and shapes for use in nodes with Transform or Objects inputs.</div></div><div id="page_dates"></div><!-- Related Topics --><!--                --><footer><!-- Disqus --><!--        --><!-- Google Translation --><!--                    --><div class="ww_skin_page_globalization"><div id="google_translate_element">&nbsp;</div></div><br /></footer></div></div><input type="hidden" id="preserve_unknown_file_links" value="false"></input><noscript><div id="noscript_warning">This site works best with JavaScript enabled</div></noscript><script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/common.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/page.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/search-client.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/unidata.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/unibreak.js"></script></body></html>
