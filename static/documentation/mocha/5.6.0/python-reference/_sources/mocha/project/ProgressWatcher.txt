Detailed Description
--------------------


    
    Progress indication class for different complex operations which might take a long time
    (e.g. rendering, exporting, etc.).
    
    There are 4 main Qt signals:
    
    * `started()`: The signal being emitted when operation starts.
    * `progress_status(int)`: The signal being emitted during operation.
    * `progress_message(unicode)`: Verbose signal being emitted during operation.
    * `finished()`: The signal being emitted when operation ends.

    :type parent: :class:`PySide.QtCore.QObject`
